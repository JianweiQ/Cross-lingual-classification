"The investors may return for fresh commitments as many of the scrips are very attractive after a series of corrections over the past several sessions," said broker Mahbub Morshed. Beximco Pharmaceuticals, Bata Shoe and BOC might rise, said one broker.

MCAT	Shenzhen's B share index was slightly up at midday on Friday but well off its intraday high due to heavy profit-taking, traders said. The index rose 1.87 points or 1.07 percent to 176.43 points, after surging to an intra-session high of 186.69 in early morning trading. Turnover was HK$232.96 million. The index soared 8.57 percent on Thursday.   "Profit-taking set in immediately after the index shot up early in the morning and I expect the market to hover around current levels in the afternoon," an analyst at Shenzhen J & A Securities said. Analysts said the index extended Thursday's gains after China's central bank, the People's bank of China, set the anti-inflation interest rate subsidy for May at zero percent. "The zero percent May subsidy could mean the goverment is likely to ease credit control," an analyst at China Guotai Securities said.   Buying was also fuelled by a report in the Shenzhen-based Securities Times which said that major fund managers in Hong Kong, optimistic over China's economic outlook, had set up funds for B share investment, analysts said.   Wafangdian Bearing Co was the best performer, gaining HK$0.41 or 7.03 percent to HK$6.24 on volume of 2.7 million shares. The stock closed at its 10 percent limit-up on Thursday, when the Shenzhen-based Securities Times reported Wafangdian Bearing Group, the listed firm's parent company, was taking over the Dalian Instrument Group. "The takeover sparked thoughts about good prospects for Wafangdian's B shares even though a company spokesman said the takeover should have no direct effect on the B share company," the Guotai analyst said.   The Shenzhen A share index lost 4.11 points or 0.89 percent to end the morning at 457.20 on turnover of 3.62 billion yuan.
MCAT	The Nairobi Stock Exchange 20-share index rose marginally on Tuesday on modest advances in Nation Printers & Publishers and Barclays Bank, bourse officials said. The index gained 19.16 points to stand at 3331.73. Turnover eased to 8.2 million shares on 194,900 shares compared to 12.6 million shillings on 478,850 shares on Monday. Barclays gained four shillings to close at 107 while Nation closed at 157 from 154. On average, shares edged marginally across the board on demand from investors seeking to buy shares they believe are cheap in a somewhat thin market. Kenya Commercial Bank traded at 86.50 from 86 while Kenya Power & Lighting Co gained 1.0 to 124. British American Tobacco closed at 62.50 from 62 while Kenya Airways traded at 8.45 from 8.40. Uchumi Supermarket was unchanged at 38.25. "A lot of the buying positions in the market right now are with foreigners while Kenya Airways has a lot of local investors seeking to offload," a senior broker said. Brokers said they expected demand for Nation to be sustained for as long as the share was trading with a bonus issue of one share for two. Brooke Bond closed at 124 from 123 while Rea Vipingo Plantations eased to 8.85 from 9.05. The Central Bank of Kenya floating rate treasury bond traded 200 million shillings at between 102.4226 and 102.4334 percent compared to 102.3762 percent on Monday. The East African Development Bank corporate bond traded 108 million shillings at between 104.025 and 104.36 percent. ($1=55 shillings). --Wambui Chege, Nairobi Newsroom ++254-2 330-261
MCAT	SIMEX Nikkei futures ended sharply higher on active buying of Tokyo stocks on Wednesday and dealers said the market seemed to have resumed its uptrend after days of lethargy. The lead Nikkei 225 June contract added 435 points to close at 20,360, 40 points off its intraday high. Turnover was a low 10,960 lots. Dealers said the launch of new pension funds spurred buying of Tokyo stocks and dealers were also eager to buy on dips on the first day of trade for June settlement.   "People were buying on the back of the fund buying and when the market broke through 20,050, it went up quite fast," a trader with a Japanese futures house said. He said the June Nikkei could head higher in the short term and make another attempt on the 20,400 level, which if taken out, would put the contract on track for the 20,550-20,600 area. "As long as we don't go below 20,200 again, the market should be very bullish," he said, noting that a number of selling orders had been absorbed at that level on Wednesday.   On Taiwan futures, spread trading dominated volume ahead of the May contract's expiry on Friday. The May MSCI contract ended lower at 346.8 on volume of 1,526 lots. June was at 344.6 on 1,721 lots. -- Sonali Desai (65-8703090)

GCAT	Kenya on Thursday downgraded a summit next week on the Zaire crisis, saying it would prepare the ground for a larger subsequent gathering of African leaders. Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka told reporters he still expected South African President Nelson Mandela to attend the March 19 summit in Nairobi. But in South Africa officials issued a programme for Mandela next week which did not include the summit. "The summit...will determine the direction in which the peace process can be pursued after which the full regional summit will be convened," Musyoka said in a statement. Kenya's role as mediator in the spreading conflict at the heart of Africa is challenged on the grounds that President Daniel arap Moi is not perceived as neutral by the rebels now controlling more than one-sixth of Zaire. Moi has not invited rebel leader Laurent Kabila to the summit. Rebel sympathisers Uganda and Rwanda are not involved and there is no confirmation so far that Zaire's ailing president, Mobutu Sese Seko, will return from France to attend. African diplomatic sources in Nairobi said they thought Mandela's attendance next Wednesday was "highly unlikely" unless 66-year-old Mobutu was present. Musyoka gave no date for the subsequent regional summit -- called Nairobi Three -- but said it would be "soon after" the meeting on the 19th. Kenya, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Cameroon were mandated by Nairobi Two last December to lead African efforts to end the fighting in Zaire and find a political settlement there and in the surrounding "Great Lakes" region of Central Africa. Since then, Kabila's forces have advanced on several fronts and are close to Kisangani, Zaire's third city. With the wind in his sails and Zaire's army failing to hold ground despite backing from mainly Serbian mercenaries, Kabila has rejected a ceasefire before negotiations about a peaceful end to Mobutu's 32-year-old rule. Kabila made a diplomatic breakthrough in his search for recognition when Mandela received him in Johannesburg on February 26. Zaire accuses Rwanda and Uganda of sponsoring Kabila's rebels and deploying troops in the eastern war zone. France has publicly accused Uganda of direct military involvement. France is also pushing, as it did late last year, for international intervention in eastern Zaire, with military backing, to assist more than 300,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees trapped there in atrocious conditions. The proposal has received no support from the United States, Britain and other Western nations. Washington has close ties with both Rwanda and Uganda, leading French officials to suspect it is sympathetic to the rebels. Musyoka said he was meeting the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, later on Thursday. Asked during a Reuters Television interview if he thought U.S. policy in the Great Lakes was positive and helpful, the Kenyan foreign minister replied: "That is a very difficult question and I want to be able in closed session to raise that matter with the ambassador herself."
GCAT	Sampdoria coach Sven Goran Eriksson was named as the new manager of Blackburn Rovers on Monday -- although he will not join the club until next July. Blackburn said that caretaker-manager Tony Parkes will remain in charge for the rest of the season. Blackburn, English champions in 1995 with Kenny Dalglish at the helm, finished seventh last season under manager Ray Harford. They made a poor start this season with Harford resigning on October 26. Since Parkes took control their fortunes have improved but he has repeatedly stressed he was not interested in the job on a long-term basis.

ECAT	Russia's State Duma lower house of parliament postponed the debate on the 1997 draft budget to December 4 from November 22, and deputies said this meant the 1997 budget was now unlikely to be passed by the year-end. Speaker Gennady Seleznyov told the Duma the budget debate was being postponed so that the Duma could first consider related bills submitted by the government on Wednesday. Tax subcommittee chairman Alexander Pochinok told Reuters the postponement meant the budget could not be passed this year. The delay is so long as there are no sittings next week. "The government has sent in seven tax bills and we must consider the changes before the first reading of the budget," Seleznyov said. Last month the Duma rejected the original draft budget with deputies criticising it for unrealistic revenue projections and inadequate spending. The government and parliament then set up a reconciliation commission, which last week agreed a new draft to be debated by the Duma. The new draft calls for a deficit of 95.40 trillion roubles, or 3.5 percent of gross domestic product. Duma budget subcommittee head Oksana Dmitriyeva told Reuters the government had presented the new bills too late. "If the Duma passes the main figures presented by the government, it will be unable to make serious changes in expenditures in the second and third readings," she said. --Anna Smirnova, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520

ECAT	Poland's finance minister said he will meet the central bank's president on Wednesday to discuss its plans to raise official interest rates in the next few weeks and signalled he might back the move. "I plan a meeting with the National Bank of Poland's (NBP) president...If we agree that such steps (a rate increase) are necessary to keep inflation in check, our attitude would be that of understanding," Belka told a news conference. NBP's head Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz told Dziennik Prawa i Gospodarki daily that the central bank would raise its discount and lombard rates, now at 25 and 22 percent, to offset the effects of a flood relief credit it had extened for the government. The move would be part of a package of actions approved by the NBP board to curb credit expansion in the economy, which would also provide for the collection by the NBP of zloty deposits with interest competitive to commercial banks. Gronkiewicz-Waltz said that if the rate rise and deposit collection fail to sufficiently curb credit expansion, the bank would impose credit limits on banks and further raise banks' obligatory reserves on deposits. Belka said said he could accept the NBP plans to start collecting deposits from individuals only as long as this proves less costly than sterilising the money market with NBP-bills. "This is a step backward from normality but the situation is not normal. So as long as this is cheaper than sterilising the market with money bills -- it is all right," he said. The government has drawn up one billion zlotys from the 2.5 billion credit line imposed on the NBP by parliament to finance the flood relief operation after the south of the country had been hit by the worst floods in centuries in early July, causing damage running in billions of dollars. The lombard and discount rates have not been changed for a year now despite declining inflation, which was at 15.3 percent in June. -- Marcin Grajewski +48 22 653 9700
GCAT	The Cuban Foreign Ministry on Thursday reiterated its refusal to comment on speculation Havana could play a role mediating an end to the hostage crisis in Peru. Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso, questioned at a weekly news briefing, said he was not aware of a formal request for the Cuban government to mediate in the crisis. Alfonso declined comment when asked if Cuba would be willing to mediate if asked, saying the question was too hypothetical. During the past two weeks, the ministry has refused comment on foreign media speculation that President Fidel Castro's government could play a role securing the release of hostages held by Marxist guerrillas at the Japanese embassy residence in Lima. The crisis erupted December 17 when an estimated 20 Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels stormed a reception at the residence and took as hostages hundreds of people, including government figures and foreign diplomats. On Thursday the rebels were holding 74 hostages after having released the rest over the course of the standoff. The leader of the rebels, Nestor Cerpa, said during a session with reporters on Tuesday that the rebels would consider mediation by Cuba or Russia.
MCAT	London stocks capped a record-breaking week by closing at their sixth consecutive all-time high on Friday but the dollar fell sharply as expectations receded of higher U.S. interest rates. The interest rate outlook produced a brief dramatic rally on Wall Street, which in turn gave London an extra lift. But it had the opposite effect on the dollar, driving the U.S. currency down by four yen and two pfennigs as dollar-denominated assets became less attractive to investors. London's cracking pace began in the morning as stocks hit a trading peak, then roared ahead again after lunch when New York opened with bigs gains. Although Wall Street dived in volatile trade towards the end of the European session, London held most of its gains. But other European bourses had a dull day.  The strong Wall Street opening helped Paris to cut its losses but Frankfurt floor trade, which ended before New York started, finished with only modest gains. London, Europe's biggest bourse, climbed by  one percent to 4,629.0 points within an hour of opening, overtaking Thursday's record close of 4,580.4, itself the fifth consecutive closing high. But investors pushed it to a new  intra-day high of 4,646 points, encouraged by the Dow Jones industrials early spurt after comments by U.S. central bank chief Alan Greenspan quelling prospects of near-term interest rate hikes. London ended at 4,630.9. London's six-day bull run, with records tumbling almost daily, has been fuelled by investors' optimism over the new Labour government's decision to give the central bank more freedom in setting interest rates. The market's enthusiasm picked up on Friday as talk of bids in the banking sector caused a shortage of stocks, forcing up prices. "It's all got a bit squeezy... fundamentally with low inflation and reasonable growth people are starting to believe that Labour will deliver," said NatWest strategist, Bob Semple. "It's an amazing market today," said one dealer. At one point,  Barclays Plc was up 65p at 1274p and the Royal Bank of Scotland surged by 60p to 662p as the outbreak of bid speculation increased demand in a sector that has risen sharply this year. London's sparkling performance contrasted sharply with bourses on continental Europe. Deals on Frankfurt's computerised IBIS index ended down a few points, depressed by the weaker dollar which was seen as harming Germany's exporting prospects. And Frankfurt floor trade ended with only modest gains with many investors having extended the Ascension Thursday holiday into a long weekend. Paris shares had a bad day, slipping in and out of profit in weak volumes in reaction to the falling dollar and an opinion poll giving the centre-right just a thin majority ahead of the May 25/June 1 election. French shares cut their losses somewhat on Wall Street's early gains but drifted lower to show losses of 0.36 percent at the close. In currencies, the dollar fell sharply against the mark and yen as a wave of uncertainty about the prevailing outlook for U.S. and Japanese interest rates swept foreign exchanges. While U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin tried to stabilise the dollar by reasserting his long-standing "strong dollar" policy, comments from Federal Reserve officials downplayed the chances of another imminent U.S. interest rate rise. The trigger for today's dollar lurch came from Federal Reserve chairman Greenspan, who overnight talked of growth slowing later this year. "The Greenspan speech was the trigger and it has shaken out a lot of people who were hoping to cruise into the weekend in fairly quiet market conditions," said Stewart Newnham, analysts at First Chicago in London. Greenspan said he expected economic growth to slow later this year and he saw scant signs now of a resurgence of inflation. Although the Fed chief said that the central bank would have to act if growth did not slow, the market took the comments to suggest there would be no interest rate rise at the next policy-making Open Market Committee meeting on May 20. STOCK PRICES London's FTSE 100 ended up 50.5 points at 4,630.9. The Paris CAC-40 index finished down 9.40 points to 2,633.91. Frankfurt's DAX index closed up 10.43 points at 3,562.41. CURRENCIES The dollar stood at 1.6843 marks compared with 1.7073 late in Europe on Thursday and 119.43 yen versus 123.76. PRECIOUS METALS Gold closed at   $346.20 after closing at $343.90 an ounce in London on Thursday. Silver was $4.87, up three cents.

CCAT	ING Barings in London said it rated Polish National Investment Funds (NFIs) No 3, 8, 6, 12 and 13 as attractive, NFIs No 1 and 14 neutral, and recommended to avoid NFIs No 10 and 11. ING Barings said in its February Eastern European Research that NFI 3 had the third-highest productivity of the funds and also showed the third-largest increase in the share of total operating profits in the first half of 1996. It said NFI 6 or Magna Polonia was attractive because its productivity was above average and the fund's management had an excellent reputation.   NFI 8 showed the second-sharpest decline in operating losses in the first half of 1996 and a net swing of seven companies into profit in the same period. It praised the sectoral exposure of NFI 12 in industrial textile companies and NFI 13's highest productivity of all funds. ING Barings recommended to avoid NFI 10 as its company portfolio was unexciting and the extent of provisioning was unclear, and NFI 11 because its productivity was low and none of its loss-making companies in 1995 became profitable in 1996. It said it was neutral on NFI 1 and NFI 14. Under Poland's mass privatisaiotn programme over 500 companies are run by 15 NFIs, which are managed by Polish-foreign consortia.

CCAT	A group including Spain's Telefonica de Espana SA and Brazil's RBS Participacoes paid 681 million reais for a 35-percent stake in Rio Grande do Sul state's telecom Cia Riograndense de Telecomunicacoes (CRT), a state official said. Jose Eichenberg, the state's justice secretary and head of the special tender committee, said the offer by the consortium led by RBS was 54.7 percent above the base price of 440 million reais.   Although the state retains a 51-percent stake in CRT, the auction was closely watched by investors and the financial market because it kicks off the opening of Brazil's telecoms sector to private capital. RBS-Telefonica group, which also includes Chile's Compania de Telecomunicaciones de Chile, Telefonica de Argentina SA and Citicorp, will be a strategic-operating partner in CRT.   Its winning offer beat out one by a group that included Italy's Stet SpA and was led by Brazil's Camargo Correa, which bid 667.8 million reais, he said. A third prequalified group, including France Telecom and led by Brazil's Banco Opportunity, did not bid. The auction of 262,352,653 voting shares, or 35 percent of CRT's capital stock, was delayed nearly two hours due to a lawsuit seeking an injunction to bar the sale. Brazil plans next year to start privatizing its massive telecommunications sector. It will start by offering cellular telephone concessions, then move to break-up and sell off its giant federally owned Telebras SA, Latin America's largest telecom. -- James Craig, Sao Paulo newsroom 5511 248 5413
ECAT	Thai consumer prices rose 4.9 percent year-on-year  in July, led by increases in the food and beverage sector, the Commerce  Ministry said on Friday. In June, the consumer price index (CPI) rose 4.4 percent, the ministry  said. On a month-on-month basis, CPI rose 0.6 percent in July against  a 0.2 percent rise in June. Analysts' expectations for the CPI had ranged from 4.6 percent to  5.4 percent. Prices of all food and beverages grew 6.9 percent year-on-year in  July, the ministry said. Non-food items gained only 3.5 percent in  the same period. The inflation figures were released a day after a slew of economic  indicators showed that Thailand's fragile economy weakened further  in May and June. The Bank of Thailand's series of economic indicators painted a grim  picture of slowing activitiy in investment, manufacturing production  and sliding imports. But higher-than-expected June foreign reserves and an improved balance  of payments figure took financial markets by surprise. Thai officials are due to announce a series of measures next Tuesday  to try and boost the sagging economy. The government is in talks with  the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for advice and possible financial  assistance.
ECAT	The Cahners Business Confidence Index (CBCI) rose to 67.4 in February from 66.6 the month before, Cahners Economics said. "The latest Cahners survey of business confidence shows the business community feeling very good about current economic conditions, with little concern that the bubble is about to burst," said Cahners economist Daryl Delano, who prepared the report. Six of the seven CBCI components increased between January and February, the report said. Product introduction rose most strongly in February, climbing 2.9 points to stand at 74.8.   The research and development index turned in the second-best performance, rising to 67.4 from 64.7 the month before. "(This) indicates that manufacturers are confident enough about the underpinnings of the economic expansion to step up their investment in new product development," Delano said. Additionally employment enjoyed a 1.5-point gain in February. Marketing spending rose 0.5 points, production sales advanced 0.4 points and inventories increased 0.1 points. Capital spending, however, fell 2.5 points to stand at 61.3. Regionally, confidence was strongest in the South, up 2.0 points in February. The index was also up 1.1 points in the West and 0.9 points in the Midwest. But the Northeast fell 0.7 points. The Cahners index is based on a monthly survey of 400 senior and mid-level manufacturing executives in cyclically sensitive industries, such as electronics and computers, construction, consumer goods and general manufacturing, the report said.

GCAT	Leaders of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) meet in Lisbon on Monday and Tuesday to discuss issues ranging from Russia and NATO enlargement to peacekeeping in Bosnia. Bringing together more than 50 nations, the Vienna-based OSCE works to prevent conflicts and ease tensions, while promoting democracy, arms control and human rights in Europe. Its roots lie in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), started by a 1975 Helsinki summit, to discuss human rights and other East-West issues of the Cold War. Renamed at a Budapest summit in 1994, the OSCE groups the United States and Canada with all European nations, covering an area in the northern hemisphere from Vancouver to Vladivostok. Fifty-four nations are expected to attend the Lisbon summit. Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro, is the 55th member but has been suspended since 1992 for its part in the Bosnian war and has not been invited. The OSCE can act only if all members agree and critics have said this requirement makes it unwieldy. But its virtue is that it is all-inclusive, unlike NATO or the European Union, and thus can work to tackle everybody's security concerns. The 1975 Helsinki agreements, on issues such as human rights and the security of borders, remained little more than paper accords until the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. At a summit in Paris in 1990, leaders pledged to use the CSCE to build a new age of cooperation in Europe and gave the forum formal structures for the first time, including a permanent secretariat. The war in former Yugoslavia which broke out the following year crippled and divided the international community, making it difficult again to use the CSCE. The low point was reached at the last summit, two years ago in Budapest, when the meeting ended in humiliating disarray after rows over NATO's plans for enlargement and how to deal with the conflict in Bosnia. Since then, with the peace agreement for Bosnia now one year old, things have improved. The OSCE took a major role in organising Bosnian elections in September, brokered an arms control deal for the Balkan region and also helped end the fighting in Chechnya. It has responsibility for most arms control in Europe. There has also been talk of the OSCE getting involved, like NATO, in peacekeeping. So far, this has not happened, although diplomatic missions have travelled to the Baltic states and to former Soviet republics including Georgia and Tajikistan. The secretariat is in Vienna, where envoys from the member countries also meet regularly.

GCAT	Prepared for Reuters by The Broadcast Monitoring Company -- COURT LIFTS THREAT TO LLOYD'S PLAN The Lloyd's of London insurance market has won an eleventh hour appeal in the US, and is now poised to make a dramatic comeback. A US court order that had threatened to undermine Lloyd's 3.2 billion stg recovery plan was overturned at a court in Baltimore yesterday, which ruled that an injunction imposed last Friday in Virginia should be dismissed, clearing the path for Lloyd's to announce its unconditional recovery plan later this week. Lloyd's has been under heavy time pressure recently because it has to pass DTI and US regulators' solvency tests in a few weeks time. -- NORMAN TO BECOME ASDA CHAIRMAN In a surprise move UK retailer Asda has announced that Archie Norman is to become the company's chairman. His post as chief executive is to be taken by Allan Leighton, Norman's current deputy.

The US government told British negotiators that there was no point in them coming to Washington as UK proposals fell so far short of "providing the essential elements of an open skies agreement that talks would not be productive." The conclusion of an open skies agreement has been made a pre-requisite of the proposed BA-American link-up by the US, a move which would create the world's most powerful aviation alliance. -- CITIBANK PLANS DOCKLANDS HQ US company Citibank has decided upon Canary Wharf in London's Docklands as the site for its planned 200-300 million stg UK headquarters, which will house 2,500 corporate banking and capital markets employees. After the property slump of the early 1990's, the development underscores the market recovery in central London. The move by Citibank will be interpreted as a vote of confidence in Canary Wharf following its acquisition by a consortium led by Mr Paul Reichmann, last year. -- GEC SHAREHOLDERS TO QUERY NEW CHIEF'S 1.5 MILLION STG PACKAGE When George Simpson takes over as managing director of General Electric Company next month he will receive one of the most potentially lucrative remuneration packages in the UK.

ECAT	Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd said on Monday it projected a 5.2 percent rise in Hong Kong's real gross domestic product (GDP) for 1997, compared with 4.6 percent expected in 1996. The inflation rate forecast for 1997 was 6.8 percent, slightly higher than the projected 6.0 percent rate for 1996, the bank's economic research unit said in a statement.   A consumption-led expansion is expected to drive the territory's economic growth in 1997, it said. "The rise in domestic consumption since the middle of this year looks set to continue in 1997, supported by the positive wealth effect generated by the prosperous local stock and property markets," economic adviser George leung said. Higher tourist income derived from the resumption of Hong Kong's sovereignty by China in 1997 was also anticipated, Hongkong Bank said. While domestic demand is expected to revive strongly, Hong Kong's external sector should also improve over this year's unstatisfactory performance, it said. Capital investment would remain buoyant on the back of ongoing infrastructure projects, with the added impetus of increased property construction, the bank said. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6441

GCAT	The Indian government, facing international concern over the country's continuing population growth, will seek to bar politicians with more than two children from contesting elections, the Press Trust of India (PTI) said on Friday. PTI quoted junior Health and Family Welfare Minister Saleem Shervani as saying the government would make "concrete efforts" to ensure passage of a bill to this effect in the February session of the parliament. Shervani told a news conference United Nations bodies, including the World Health Organisation, had expressed serious concern at India's unending problems with family planning. India's current population is estimated at about 950 million. Official estimates say it grew at an average annual rate of 1.8 per cent between 1990 and 1995. A forced family planning programme was partly responsible for the 1977 election defeat of then prime minister Indira Gandhi and the family planning ministry was later renamed as the Ministry of Family Welfare.
MCAT	The Philippines will reduce the total offering for Monday's Treasury bills auction to two billion pesos from last week's 2.5 billion, a Bureau of Treasury official said on Friday. Offers for the 91-day and 182-day T-bills will be cut to 500 million pesos each from the previous one billion. The volume for 364-day T-bills will be raised to one billion pesos from 500 million. The higher offering for the one-year bills will correct the inverted yield curve registered in last week's auction, the official said. On Monday, the average one-year bill rate was 13.106 percent, while that for three-month bills was 13.174 percent. Traders said three-month bill rate was expected to remain firm as the central bank has yet to lower its term reverse repo rates. The Treasury also decided to offer another series of short-term bills on Tuesday. Offering size was likewise reduce to three billion pesos from last week's six billion. Offers for the 35-day and 42-day bills will be cut to 1.5 billion pesos each from last week's three billion. -- Manila Newsroom (63 2) 841-8938 Fax 817-6267
CCAT	Apple Computer Inc. stunned investors Wednesday by reporting an unexpected $25 million fourth quarter profit, stemming a year of management turmoil and swelling red ink. The Cupertino, Calif.-based computer maker, which had been expected to report a loss of 30 cents a share, posted a profit of 20 cents a share for the last three months of fiscal 1996, its first quarterly profit this year. In the same quarter a year ago, Apple earned $60 million, or 48 cents per share. Included in the most recent quarter's operating results was a gain of $17 million. Fourth-quarter revenue for fiscal 1996 declined 23 percent to $2.32 billion from $3 billion. Apple released the news after the market closed and its shares jumped as much as $4.25 to $30 a share in after-hours trading. Industry analysts attributed the profit to Apple's aggressive cost cutting, a bigger-than-expected exodus of employees and lower prices for key components, such as memory chips. "It is a shock," said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst at JP Morgan in San Francisco who was expecting a loss. "It seems they've brought the break-even point for their business down pretty dramatically. This is very encouraging." Most important to investors, Apple could remain profitable in coming quarters, which would bolster confidence among consumers that it will be around for years and keep loyal customers from switching to IBM-compatible personal computers, analysts said. Fred Anderson, Apple's chief financial officer, stopped short of predicting a profit in the first fiscal quarter. He said, however, that he expects the company's costs to increase only slightly in the December quarter on higher advertising expenses and that first-quarter revenue should be about the same as in the fourth fiscal quarter. "We continue to make progress in strengthening Apple's financial condition, as our $410 million in positive cash flow from operations during the quarter suggests," Anderson said. "We've reduced inventories by nearly $400 million since June and completed the quarter with over $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments," he said in a statement. In the previous three quarters, Apple reported huge losses because of declining Macintosh sales, management turmoil and growing popularity of personal computers running Microsoft's Windows software, which compete with Macintosh. The company began slashing its costs when former National Semiconductor Corp. chief Gilbert Amelio took charge of Apple in February. With most of the cost-cutting plan completed, Apple now will concentrate on the much tougher task of increasing revenue, Anderson said. While shipments were down 26 percent in the fourth quarter to 932,000 units from the year-ago quarter, Apple said shipments were up 11 percent from the third quarter, a sign that customers were once again buying Apple's products. Apple has a slew of new products in the works. On Monday, the company is expected to unveil a new low-end PowerBook, a much-needed portable computer to replace Apple's older glitch-prone models. In the first calendar quarter, the company also is expected to introduce new low-end consumer desktop models, a niche from which Apple had retreated in an effort to cut costs. For the full year, Apple reported a loss of $816 million, or $6.59 a share, reflecting a series of hefty one-time charges for inventory writedowns and restructurings. In fiscal 1995, Apple earned $424 million, or $3.45 a share. Revenue for the year fell 11 percent to $9.83 billion from $11.1 billion a year ago.
ECAT	Indonesia, hosting the annual meeting of foreign ministers from Islamic states, on Monday pushed its vision of economic cooperation and development for the Moslem world. President Suharto said in an opening address to the 53-member Organisation of the Islamic Conference that OIC nations were better positioned than any other group of developing countries because they had "the most complete array of institutional and operational instruments for the conduct of economic cooperation". But he said there was a clear need "to reinvigorate and mobilise" those instruments and operate them in a more coherent and effective manner. Suharto also called for greater private-sector cooperation through the Islamic Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Before the five-day meeting opened on Monday, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas had stressed Indonesia's aim of promoting economic cooperation, development and investment in the Islamic world with its 1.5 billion people. As chairman of the conference, he said in an introductory speech on Monday that the Islamic world possessed "enormous potential in terms of natural resources, financial means and even technological capabilities". OIC nations, which include the rich, oil-producing states of the Gulf, had the Islamic Development Bank and an information network to support initiatives, a preferential trade system, a long-term financing scheme and an investment and export credit corporation, he said. But he added: "As yet we have not achieved significant levels of economic cooperation or investment relations." Intra-OIC trade amounts to only 10 percent of the total trade volume of OIC members, while 60 percent of members' trade is done with developed countries. Alatas said the group needed to make good use of the existing database at the Trade and Information Network of Islamic Countries and the OIC information network system. He said it also needed to launch effective trade and investment programmes and mobilise the private sector for economic copperation. "The important thing is for us to muster the political will to make our actions catch up with our vision and rouse our dormant capabilities," he said. Suharto called for a strengthening of cooperation among OIC members while also fostering dialogue rather than confrontation with the developed world to achieve comprehensive and systematic global economic development.
GCAT	With rebels poised to end President Mobutu Sese Seko's rule over Zaire after three decades of almost absolute power, members of a privileged inner circle face an increasingly bleak future. Here are a few of the better-known names in the beleaguered president's entourage: BOBI LADAWA "Mama" Bobi Ladawa and Mobutu celebrated their 17th wedding anniversary on May 1. She was Mobutu's mistress when his first wife Antoinette died in 1977. Often at her ailing husband's side, she is considered one of his closest advisers. NZANGA MOBUTU Son of Bobi Ladawa and Mobutu. Little known until the rebellion began in October. He has played a central role in promoting his father, acting as a spokesman and adviser. NGAWALE MOBUTU Mobutu's daughter to his first wife Antoinette. Ngawale is one of his numerous family advisers. CAPTAIN KONGOLO MOBUTU Mobutu's son and an officer in the elite presidential guard, his exploits in Kinshasa earned him the nickname "Saddam Hussein". Fiercely loyal to his father, he is among those in charge of Mobutu's personal security. HONORE NGBANDA Mobutu's nephew and special security adviser, he is seen as one of his closest aides. A preacher in his spare time, he was dubbed the "terminator" after leading Mobutu's repressive internal security apparatus. He was Mobutu's representative in exploratory peace talks with rebels in South Africa. FELIX VUNDUAWE TE PEMAKO An eminence grise from Mobutu's Ngbandi tribe, he has directed the president's cabinet since 1992. SETI YALE Long one of Mobutu's closest advisers but rarely seen in public, he is reputed to be among Zaire's wealthiest businessmen. Of mixed Portuguese-Zairean parentage, he is from Mobutu's Equateur Province. BEMBA SAOLONA Formerly the president's personal financial adviser, Bemba is one of Zaire's leading businessmen. In recent months he openly critised the monetary policy of the government of former Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo and its handling of the war. After losing land and plantations to rebel advances he was one of the first Mobutu allies to call for a negotiated settlement. Like Seti, he is half Portuguese and originates from Equateur. TSHIBOMBO MAKUNA A Muluba from Kasai Province, he has no family or ethnic links to the president. As chief of the internal security services, he reputedly played a key role in co-opting political opponents of the president during the seven-year democratic transition process which began in 1990. GENERAL NZIMBI NZALE Commander of the elite presidential guard, made up mostly of Mobutu's Ngbandi tribe. He is one of a handful of hardcore loyalists among the generals. In a televised pep-talk to his troops in April, he urged them to defend Mobutu to the death. GENERAL BARAMOTO KPAMA Another hardcore loyalist. Family links to Mobutu reputedly facilitated his rapid ascent in the army. He took command in the late 1980s of the civil guard, the unit most feared by civilians. Recently sidelined during a reshuffle of the senior command, he is widely reported to have fled to South Africa. GENERAL MAHELE LIEKO BOKUNGU Minister of defence and chief of staff of the armed forces, he is another fierce loyalist. Unlike many generals, he earned his four stars on the battlefield and not through family links to Mobutu. Mahele began his career as Mobutu's personal security chief in the 1960s. From the Mbuza tribe, a sister tribe to Mobutu's Ngbandi, Mahele originates from Equateur. BANZA MUKALAYI Vice-president of Mobutu's Popular Revolutionary Movement (MPR) party. He was credited with breathing new life into the party during the democratic transition. He has the president's ear on political matters. From southern Shaba province, he has no family link to Mobutu. LANDO KOTA MBONGO KPWENGBALE Long term private secretary of Mobutu and a relative. ALBERT HENRI BUISINE Mobutu's personal attendant. The diminutive Frenchman has been by Mobutu's side since 1988, first as a member of his domestic staff, and later as chief of domestic staff. His direct access to Mobutu made him highly sought after by people seeking audiences with the president. He has been less prominent in the president's entourage recently.

GCAT	Steffi Graf will be out of action for two weeks because of the knee injury which forced her to withdraw from the Pan Pacific final in Tokyo at the weekend.

MCAT	Stocks fell for the fourth consecutive session Monday as concerns about upward pressure on wages lifted long-term interest rates to the highest level in four months. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 35.79 points to 6,660.69, putting the blue-chip index about 223 points below the record of 6,883.90 set on Jan. 21. In the broader market, declining issues beat advances 1,654 to 831 on heavy volume of 445.5 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. In the inflation sensitive bond market, the benchmark 30-year Treasury fell 21/32, or $6.56 on a $1,000 bond, raising its yield to 6.94 percent from 6.89 percent on Friday. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions. The last time the yield closed higher was on Sept. 24 when it stood at 6.99 percent. Bond yields of 7 percent or so tend to draw funds away from stocks. "What's significant is that at seven percent, the yield on bonds is clearly competition for stocks," said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock & Co. A sustained rise in interest rates could change the character of the market, which has seen stocks move in tandem with bonds. Instead, some strategists are now recommending not only avoiding new investments in stocks, but actually shifting assets in favour of alternatives. "We've had a whale of a bull market, and from my work it looks like we should have a rest," said John Wosczyna, market strategist at Roney & Co. "For me, to sell stocks here and buy bonds is a good decision," he said, adding that he thought stocks had already peaked or would do so in the next several weeks. Analysts said the market's focus will be on Tuesday's report by the Labour Department of the Employment Cost Index for the fourth quarter. Consensus estimates were that the index rose 0.9 percent. Should it come in stronger than a 1.0 percent rise, analysts said that could spark a sharp sell-off in bonds and sharply higher yields. "There's rampant fear in the bond market that tomorrow's ECI number is going to be ugly," said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. "People think this is one report that (Federal Reserve Chairman) Alan Greenspan holds dear," he said. Orlando said investors would likely view a sharp rise in labour costs as helping to convince the Fed, the nation's central bank, to raise short-term rates at its next meeting of policy-makers in February in a bid to ward off inflation. While the Dow's decline has narrowed since it fell 59 points on Friday and 94 points on Thursday, the performance in the broader market showed signs of deterioration as declining stocks swamped advances. The Dow lost 34 points on Wednesday. Weakest among the 30 Dow components was International Business Machines Corp., which fell 5-1/2 to 145, bringing the drop to 23 points in the last four sessions. Among individual issues, Measurex Corp. surged 10-1/4 to 34-1/2 after agreeing to be acquired by Honeywell Inc. for $35 per share in cash. Honeywell fell 5/8 to 69-3/8. Software Spectrum Inc. tumbled 10-1/2 to 23 in the first day of trading since the company warned late Friday that its quarterly earnings would be below expectations. The Nasdaq composite index fell 11.02 points to 1,352.81. The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 5.50 to 765.02. The American Stock Exchange index fell 2 to 586.16. The NYSE composite index of all listed common stocks fell 2.73 to 402.78. The average share was down 28 cents. The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 7,413.323, down 53.882 or 0.72 percent.

But he gave no figures. Savino, listed on the Milan Bourse since February last year, posted 1996 net profit of 3.7 billion lire.

ECAT	Hong Kong's economy is well along the road to recovery with private consumption leading the way, government data revealed on Monday. "Although I've been looking for private consumption recovery, these figures are much stronger than I expected," said Sun Bae Kim, chief economist at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government said gross domestic product grew by 5.1 percent in the third quarter of 1996 against 4.6 percent in the second quarter. Private consumption showed a year-on-year increase of 4.5 percent in real terms over a year earlier while government consumption increased by a real 5.3 percent. "This GDP figure is in line with our expectations but the growth in private consumption is quite a good improvement," said Eddie Wong, chief economist at HG Asia in Hong Kong. The figures confirm that unlike in other years, private consumption is leading Hong Kong towards economic recovery in line with the shift in the territory's economy away from exports and into services. The figures also confirm that Hong Kong is well on its way to achieving the government forecast of a 4.7-percent increase in gross domestic product for the year. "There are no big surprises here and Hong Kong should reach the government forecast," said Wong. The increase in private consumption countered a slowdown in investment following the nearing completion of the Chek Lap Kok airport construction project. "That was an important driver of growth in the 1994 and 1995 and that's starting to unwind somewaht so the pick-up in consumption has become all the more important because of that," said Kim. The external sector also showed some improvement, with total exports rising 4.9 percent in real terms. Re-exports rose by eight percent, while domestic exports fell by 9.9 percent. Imports of goods grew by 3.4 percent. But the GDP implicit deflator sank to 4.6 percent from 6.5 percent, suggesting that terms of trade are worsening. Economists said the weaker number suggests that the price of imports is rising faster than the price of exports. Exports of services rose 7.1 percent in real terms in the third quarter over a year earlier. The corresponding growth rate for imports of services was only 1.7 percent. -- Sarah Davison (852) 2843 6470
GCAT	The people of Santiago Atitlan on Monday commemorated the death of 13 men and boys killed on Dec. 2, 1990, when soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration outside the military base. "We heard the shots, but when we arrived they were dead," Felipa Pitzay, 28, told Reuters in remembering that day. "The army used to kill for nothing, accusing people of being guerrillas ... they killed for pleasure." The Mayan Indians of this town remember the massacre as one of the worst chapters in Guatemala's 36-year-old civil war -- which is due to end with peace accords later this month. On Dec. 29, the government and leftist guerrillas of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit (URNG) are expected to sign a peace treaty ending decades of bloodshed. The 1990 massacre in Santiago Atitlan came during the last weeks of the government of President Vinicio Cerezo, who then was the first elected civilian ruler in nearly three decades. It provoked such an outcry that it led to the unprecedented withdrawal of the military base from the village. "It was one of the lamentable incidents of the armed conflict -- that because of a lack of care, military personnel caused the death of people in the civilian population," army spokesman Col. Edgar Palacios told Reuters. Massacres are embedded in the history of Guatemala's armed conflict, which has killed an estimated 100,000 people, mostly civilians, and left another 40,000 missing. About 1,000 of Santiago Atitlan's 29,000 people came to a Roman Catholic Mass at the massacre site, an empty space once occupied by the military base. Thomas McSherry, a priest from Oklahoma City, led the Mass, saying it was "for all those members of the community who suffered from the violence." "This is a mixed celebration," said Mayor Manuel Sicay. "It's sad, remembering what happened, but it's also happy because the army left and now life is tranquil."

"We have had initial discussions with Oxbow and Marubeni and we are confident of firming up a partnership soon," FPPC chief operating officer Ernesto Pantangco told reporters. Pantangco said the company is keen on participating in the bidding of the state-owned geothermal exploration firm. The bidding has been set for April this year. He added that the consortium would need to raise about $200 million for the acquisition. - Manila newsroom 63 2 8418938 Fax 8176267
GCAT	A group of activists apologised on Thursday for forcing their way into the Japanese consulate in Hong Kong and promised Japanese residents and tourists in the British colony they were not in danger. Anti-Japanese demonstrators have adopted an almost daily routine of marches to the Japanese mission, chanting slogans condemning Japan's claim to a group of uninhabited islands which China calls the Diaoyus and Japan calls the Senkakus. The protesters occupied the consulate lobby on Wednesday, pushing past security guards to stage a noisy 30-minute sit-in. One security guard was injured in the incident, which was broken up by police. "Our team apologises for running into some consulate employees and the minor injury caused to one of them, and the inconvenience caused to citizens applying for visas at the consulate during yesterday's incident," legislator Albert Ho told a news conference. "Our group wants to clarify the Diaoyu protection campaign is aimed only at the Japanese right-wing government and militarists and we don't pose any threat to the safety of Japanese expatriates, tourists or Hong Kong-based Japanese organisations including the consulate and their employees." The Japanese consulate responded by tightening security and announced it no longer would accept hand-delivered petitions. It asked protesters to mail in their grievances. Emotions were fanned when a Hong Kong activist drowned last month after he jumped into stormy waters around the islands in a bid to demonstrate Chinese claims. Japanese Consulate spokesman Tsuguyoshi Hada said the mission was considering closing the visa section during future demonstrations to protect applicants. "We are not taking any concrete action (against the demonstrators) but we trust the Hong Kong government would take formal, appropriate action," Hada said. Controversy over the islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan, ballooned when a group of Japanese rightists erected a lighthouse on one of them and planted flags in July. Beijing's de facto consular mission in Hong Kong said on Thursday it had no plans to hand over what it described as a threatening letter received from a right-wing Japanese group, a spokesman said on Thursday. "Now, for the moment, we do not plan to report to the police. We need to see further developments before we consider what further action to take," a spokesman for China's Xinhua News Agency branch in Hong Kong said by telephone. Xinhua said earlier this week the letter threatened to kill and injure Chinese in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan. Governor Chris Patten on Wednesday urged Xinhua to hand over the letter to Hong Kong police for investigation.
CCAT	Germany's Commerzbank AG was cut to "underperform" from "neutral" at Lehman Brothers, a research note from analyst Robert Law at the brokerage said on Friday.   Law said Commerzbank had a similar business mix to its two larger domestic competitors but lacked their size and resources. He said the stock included a "substantial speculative premium" and that recent strength should be used as an opportunity to reduce holdings. The stock was down 18 pfennigs at 43.45 marks. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 5106
GCAT	Astronauts aboard the Columbia guided the shuttle into position early on Wednesday to retrieve an orbiting telescope as NASA ground controllers mulled whether the crew should return home early to avoid bad weather at landing sites. Through a series of precise rocket burns and manoeuvres, the five-member crew was to fly within 35 feet (10.6 metres) of the Orfeus-Spas, a German-made space telescope. The telescope has been flying in formation with Columbia since the crew released it on November 19, just a few hours after the shuttle left its launch pad at Kennedy Space Centre. Astronaut Tom Jones was to use the shuttle's robot arm to pluck the satellite from space at 3:11 a.m. EST (0811 GMT) and tuck it into the payload bay for the ride home. Scientists on the ground hope to collect data from the ultra-violet telescope to learn more about the life cycle of stars, especially the gaseous, soupy matter that acts as a nursery for stars outside the earth's solar system. The space agency was to decide sometime after 9 a.m. EST (1400 GMT) if the crew would remain in orbit until Friday, or return one day earlier on Thursday. Rainy weather was forecast for the shuttle's preferred landing site at Kennedy Space Centre in Florida on Friday, and high winds were expected at two alternative landing sites on the U.S. West Coast, ground controller Marc Garneau said. A Thursday landing would actually be in line with NASA's original flight plan for the mission. Controllers on Monday gave the crew the green light to remain in orbit an extra day to do more troubleshooting of a stuck hatch. "We would prefer to proceed with the orderly conduct of the remaining events of this flight, including the documentation of the (stuck) hatch conditions that have been sent up to us and shoot for a landing on flight day 17," said shuttle commander Kent Cockerell. The astronauts had plenty of food, water and oxygen, and "an excellent crew attitude" in case the orbiter's return was delayed beyond Friday, Cockerell said. The jammed airlock hatch last weekend was a major disappointment of the 17-day mission. The unyielding hatch prevented two astronauts from leaving the orbiter and making a pair of lengthy space walks to test construction materials for the planned orbiting space station. It was the first time in the 15-year history of the U.S. shuttle programme that an airlock hatch has jammed. NASA officials said they were still trying to figure out the cause of the problem. But NASA engineers said they were pleased with the performance of the Orfeus-Spas telescope during its two-week- long flight about 26 miles (42 km) behind the shuttle. The 7,000 pound (3,175 kg) satellite telescope is one of the largest ever deployed in space, ranking second only to the Hubble Space Telescope. The astronaut crew slowed down Columbia with rocket thrusters early on Wednesday, then leapfrogged over the telescope to position the shuttle behind the Orfeus-Spas. The shuttle was to fly within about 2,000 feet (610 metres) of the telescope when the crew was to slowly guide the orbiter to within about 35 feet (10.6 metres) at a speed of about one-tenth of a foot per second (three cm per second).
MCAT	* Lithuanian shares were mixed on Wednesday and the sluggish market remained inactive, dealers said. * Kalnapilis brewery gained big, rising ten percent to 3.85 litas. * Savings Bank fell steeply to 255 litas from 284 litas. Lithuanian shares were mixed on Wednesday and activity on the struggling bourse was slow , dealers said. "Trade is down from yesterday," Arvydas Jacikevichius of brokerage house Suprema told Reuters. The bourse has struggled to regain the momentum it had early in the year, when prices soared to record highs. Dealers and analysts say that bull run was speculative and the market has since experienced a long, painful correction. One of the session's few big gainers was Kalnapilis brewery, which advanced 10 percent to 3.85 litas. "It should continue to gain and reach to 4.00 to 4.50 litas in the nearset future," Jacikevichius said. On the down side, the state-run Savings Bank fell ten percent to 255 litas from 284 litas. Hermis Bank, which earlier announced a preliminary net profit of 3.2 million litas in April and 12.5 million litas in the first four months of the year, saw its shares drop to 175 litas from 180 litas. "When the market is going down, the results are not going to have much of an effect," said Tomas Andrejauskas of Suprema. "When the market starts to go up again, Hermis shares will have a higher relative performance," he added. Lithuanian Gas remained unchanged at 2.00 litas. Rokishkis Cheese, which reported on Wednesday that its sales went down slightly in April, fell to 44.50 litas from 44.95 litas. --Andrius Vilkancas, Vilnius newsroom +370 2 22 35 18

CCAT	Chile's giant Collahuasi copper mine expects to produce its first electro-won cathodes in October next year, three months ahead of schedule, said a company official. "We hope to start the oxide plant working in June or July next year. The first cathodes should be ready in September or October," William Gysling, corporate affairs manager, told Reuters by telephone. It takes three three months to produce cathodes using heap-leaching technology which involves pouring acid over mineral to extract the copper. The mine, the largest copper project currently under construction in Chile, was originally scheduled to start production in late 1998. It will produce 380,000 tonnes of copper a year, including 50,000 tonnes of cathodes and 330,000 of copper in concentrates from sulphide reserves. The sulphides plant is likely to produce its first concentrates in November 1998, but the start-up will depend on whether the pit's port at Punta Patache is ready, said Gysling. "We are working to try and make sure the first line of the sulphides plant is ready in November," he said. "But we have to make sure other projects like the port are also brought forward." Concentrates will be pumped along a 215 kilometer-long pipeline across the desert for loading at Punta Patache south of Iquique. Collahuasi is 44 percent owned by each of Luxembourg-based Minorco and Canada's Falconbridge with a Japanese consortium led by Mitsui holding 12 percent. The mine lies at a breath-taking 4,400 meters above sea level on a barren Andean plateau close to the border with Bolivia. ((-- Margaret Orgill, Santiago newsroom, 562-699-5595x212))
CCAT	Jostens Inc on Tuesday said it expected a new inventory cost accounting system to boost its earnings by $0.26 a share in the six months ending June 30, including an expected benefit of $0.17 a share in the second quarter. In a statement Jostens did not provide an estimate of second-quarter earnings, and company officials were not immediately available for comment.   Earlier, Jostens reported first-quarter earnings of $0.26 a share, which included a $0.09 benefit from the new cost accounting system introduced last summer. First-quarter results also reflected a charge against earnings of $3.0 million, or $0.05 a share, to close a plant.   Excluding the cost-accounting impact and the charge, Jostens said it earned about $0.22 for the quarter. Jostens also said it was introducing new contract terms and clarifying policies for its 350 independent sales agents in its high school jewelry and graduation products businesses. The changes, developed at the request and with the involvement of sales representatives, will take effect July 1. The company expects some turnover in its sales force as a result of the changes. No further details were immediately available. During the first quarter, Jostens completed the development of a strategy to generate more business in the U.S. college market. That strategy, which was previously announced, includes changing from an independent sales force to an employee sales force for the college market. The 52 independent sales agents who serve the college market were notified that their contracts will not be renewed. Offers of employment have been extended, it added.

CCAT	Ispat Industries Ltd's planned eight billion rupees ($223 million) rights issue will go ahead at the end of April despite the political uncertainties plaguing the country's stock markets, the company's finance director said in a newspaper interview published on Sunday. "The question of deferring the issue does not arise at all," the Financial Express quoted finance director Vivek Sett as saying. "I believe the issue will be fully subscribed," he said in an interview with the newspaper. "My confidence is based on two factors. First, 25 percent of the company's shares are held by the promoters, and the debentures will be taken up by them. "Second the instruments have been planned in an attractive manner. The holders of the debentures, priced at 100 rupees each, will have the option to convert it into equity after 18 months. The market is bad now, but it may change for the better. "For these 18 months, investors will get a fixed return of 17 percent per annum. Considering the market conditions it is a lucrative offer. "If the market is poor at the time of conversion, the holder will be offered 20 percent discount to the market price of the share. This means he will get a return of 17 percent per annum plus 20 percent discount to market price, annualised at 10 percent. The total return would thus be 27 percent per annum." Sett defended Ispat's debt funding strategy, which saw the companies debt-equity ratio reach 4:1 at the end of the 1995/96 financial year (April-March). He said at the end of 1996/97 debt had risen by two billion rupees, but financial institutions readiness to lend vouched for their confidence in Ispat's ability to service the debt. "We have a good debt service coverage ratio of 1.5, although a figure of 1 is considered good. "We have another advantage. We have garnered 3.9 billion rupees via convertible Euro bonds. These will be repaid by 2001." Sett said that since no repayments against the bonds were due for five years, it gave the company enough scope to service other debts. The flagship of India's ML MIttal Ispat group has an asset base of 15 billion rupees, and by the year 2000 the diversified Ispat Group expects to have an asset base of 200 billion rupees, and a turnover of 100 billion rupees, the report said. The group specialises in core sectors like steel, power, telecommunications and infrastructure. Sett said Ispat's a new hot strip mill project will begin production in October and will be fully onstream by August, 1998.
CCAT	Tough conditions in its poultry operations and high world grain prices will leave South African diversified food group Tiger Oats Ltd with only a modest increase in year earnings, analysts said Thursday. But contributions from its listed food subsidiaries, Langeberg Holdings Ltd and Oceana Fishing Group Ltd, and unlisted wholesaling operation Spar, were seen remaining strong. "Tiger's poultry operations will have been under pressure along with the rest of the industry mainly due to the pressure put on selling prices by Rainbow Chicken Ltd ," said John Moses, an analyst at brokerage Frankel Pollak. Although the Tiger unit had been profitable in the previous financial year, it was seen unable to weather hefty price cuts engineered by loss-making chicken producer Rainbow in a bid to cut its excess stock levels and regain market share. Another analyst said the whole poultry industry remained in an oversupply situation. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast Tiger's earnings before exceptionals rising to between 344 and 351 cents a share in the year to September 30, with a consensus of 348.3 -- a 12 percent gain on last year. Tiger is due to report results on Tuesday. Tiger's staple food division, consisting of its maize and wheat milling and baking operations, was seen making a dull contribution to group profits due to high input costs from record high world maize prices earlier this year, analysts said. "We do not expect any of the staple food operations to have done excellently. Agricultural commodity prices were still very high," another analyst said. But listed food interests, Langeberg which last week reported a 32.5 percent rise in earnings to 49.7 cents a share and Oceana with a 30 percent increase to 48.6 cents would help the bottomline. Expectations for the wholesaling division of Spar, Radue Wir and Browns Cash and Carry was upbeat. "The Spar-side should have done well. Retail sales figures are still overall very good, with food which is Spar's biggest item, leading the way," an analyst said. Some uncertainty existed about a change in the contribution to Tiger's earnings from its pharmaceutial subsdiary, Adcock Ingram Ltd, following its merger with rival Premier Pharmaceutical Co Ltd , a deal backdated to May 1. On balance, analysts expected it to remain unchanged at last year's levels as a higher contribution at operating level offset an increased minority stake in the merged company. -- Johannesburg newsroom 27 11 482 1003

GCAT	Four Japanese businessmen were among seven hostages released on Wednesday by Marxist guerrillas at the besieged Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima, according to Red Cross officials. The officials identified them as Makoto Sekiguchi and Haruo Takahashi, from the Mitsui company, and Yonezo Urata and Toyoaki Toda, of Matsushita Electric.   Two Peruvians of Japanese descent -- Jose Kamiya, of the Sistemas Sukiyaki company, and Alberto Yamamoto, president of the government's national development institute (INADE) -- were also among the released captives. The seventh released hostage was identified as Peruvian privatization official Juan Assereto Duaret. Wednesday's releases left 74 hostages in the residence that Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels stormed on Dec. 17, taking more than 500 captives.
GCAT	Taking a stand for Moses, the U.S. House of Representatives voted on Wednesday in favour of displaying the Ten Commandments in government offices and courthouses. The 295-125 vote on the non-binding resolution was prompted by an Alabama court case over a judge's display of the commandments in his courtroom. Proponents of the resolution said the issue was about the U.S. national heritage founded on Judeo-Christian principles. Critics said the House should not promote two religions at the expense of others or try to interfere in a pending court case. The Alabama Supreme Court is reviewing an order to Alabama circuit court judge Roy Moore to remove a hand-carved version of the Ten Commandments from the wall of his court. Representative Charles Canaday, a Florida Republican, told the House on Tuesday the resolution was not designed to pressure the courts but to "acknowledge that the Ten Commandments are the foundation of the legal order in the United States and throughout Western civilisation." Virginia Democrat Robert Scott said that posting the commandments amounted to government establishment of religion - outlawed by the U.S. Constitution.

ECAT	The IMF is likely to approve the 1997 part of Russia's three-year loan programme next month and disbursements should resume "immediately after that", IMF managing director Michel Camdessus said Thursday. Camdessus, speaking at a news conference, did not say how many monthly tranches of the loan would be paid. But he said the IMF was looking at ways to improve the flexibility of disbursing tranches of its three-year, $10 billion loan.   "I am reasonably certain that we can present the second tranche of the three-year programme to the approval of the (IMF) board in May and that disbursement would restart immediately after that," Camdessus said. The IMF has delayed paying several tranches of the loan because it is worried about dismally low tax revenues. Russian officials have played down any problems caused by the delays and First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said in Moscow on Thursday that IMF loans were now less important to Russia because Moscow could tap world capital markets for funds. Camdessus said he had been impressed with Russia's new team of ministers -- including Chubais -- during a visit to Moscow at the start of this month. "I was very impressed with the quality of the new government," he said. "It is quite refreshing to see such a strong determination to address squarely the basic issues."   Camdessus, who has already predicted that Russia could become an economic superpower if reforms stayed on track, said adherence to the IMF loan programme could pave the way for solid growth in Russia. "If this programme is continued, as it is expected to be, until the end of this century, Russia will enter the next millennium with a solid, sustained base for growth and the improved living standards of the population," he said. He warned about the problems caused by the low tax revenues and added: "I have said that the prolongation of this crisis would mean probably major risk of anarchy and dictatorship in the country."

GCAT	Ricky Ponting is recalled in place of fellow middle order batsman Michael Bevan to face England in the fourth Ashes test, Australia confirmed on Wednesday. Ponting's return for the match starting on Thursday is the only change to the side who won the third test at Old Trafford by 268 runs to level the six-test series 1-1. Bevan had been hoping to revive his test career on the Headingley ground where he batted impressively in two seasons of county cricket with Yorkshire. However, he has paid for his failure to cope with short-pitched England bowling and a consequent run of low scores -- totalling 43 runs in five innings. Ponting said: "I've only missed eight test matches, but it feels like it's been forever." He was dropped after two tests of the 1996-97 home series against West Indies, despite having made 88 in his first innings at Brisbane last November. Ponting effectively secured his recall with an unbeaten 126 against Glamorgan last week. England will pick from 12, and if Dean Headley is passed fit after a side strain, fellow paceman Andy Caddick may be omitted to give a test debut to Gloucestershire's Mike Smith. Caddick was unimpressive at Old Trafford and England are expected to prefer the variety which left-arm swing bowler Smith would offer. Born in Yorkshire, he left the county without making the same impression as Darren Gough, who will open the bowling in front of his home crowd. "That gives you a lift, but every game's a home game in a test match," Gough said. "It's important for us to win this one." That message has been stressed to the England players in four days of mental and physical preparation. "It's like the start of a short three-match series," said their captain Michael Atherton. "It's the pivotal test of the summer." Australian captain Mark Taylor disagreed and was more concerned about the late change of pitch ordered by the England camp at the weekend because the original strip had bare patches with little grass cover. "It seems very late to be doing that," Taylor said. "The decision should have been made earlier. It looks a touch underprepared, doesn't feel that hard and lacks a bit of rolling." Teams: England (from) - Michael Atherton (captain), Mark Butcher, Alec Stewart, Nasser Hussain, Graham Thorpe, John Crawley, Mark Ealham, Robert Croft, Darren Gough, Mike Smith, Andy Caddick, Dean Headley. Australia - Mark Taylor (captain), Matthew Elliott, Greg Blewett, Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Ian Healy, Shane Warne, Paul Reiffel, Jason Gillespie, Glenn McGrath.
MCAT	U.S. shares were narrowly mixed in light and featureless dealing in London after yesterday's whipsaw trading session. London dealers said they saw little reaction to a second U.S. attack on Iraq, and were expecting the Dow -- down by some 50 points early in yesterday's session before ending with a 32-point gain -- to open steady. Shares in U.S. oil companies, which rose after news of the initial U.S. raid, were flat in London. "There's not a lot going on at all. Trading has been spotty," said one dealer.   Shares in Boeing Co climbed $1/8 to $90-3/4 after news that the aircraft manufacturer said it won a $1.18 billion order for seven 747-400 jumbo jets from Philippine Airlines. McDonalds Corp shares slipped $3/8 to $46 in London in reaction to an article in the Wall Street Journal that said the fast-food restaurant's new burger was not doing well. Shares in Digital Equipment slipped another $3/8 in London after stumbling $1-5/8 in New York yesterday after the company said orders were slow. In other trading, the September S&P 500 futures contract was 0.30 lower at 655.55 on Globex at 1028 GMT.   The September 30-year Treasury bond futures contract was up 1/32 at 107-30/32. Trading volume was light. Traders said they expect U.S. stock trading to grind to a halt until Friday's release of the August employment report. A strong set of figures is likely to prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. --Debra Sherman, London newsroom +44 171 542 4026
ECAT	Growth in international merchandise trade has slowed sharply this year after running at three times the rate of expansion in the global economy in 1995, the World Trade Organisation reported Monday. In a survey issued as trade ministers and officials from the 128 WTO countries started a key conference in Singapore, the Geneva-based body said trade volume was likely to increase this year by only 5 percent compared with 8 percent last year. "Although global GDP (gross domestic product) growth is expected to remain roughly unchanged in 1996 as compared with 1995, the rate of increase in global trade is expected to slow significantly," the WTO's annual report said. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the world economy is likely to expand by 3 percent in 1996, just slightly faster than last year. Earlier this year, WTO analysts predicted only a "modest" decline in trade growth to around 7 percent, both in value and volume, for 1996. The report said the slowdown "may be somewhat sharper than predicted" -- although it added a note of optimism, saying growth would accelerate again in 1997 as economic activity picked up in Western Europe. Speaking to the conference Monday, WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero said the report "shows how trade continues to be a powerful engine of growth," citing last year's figure, though he made no reference to the decline this year. For 1996, the report said, the value of world goods trade "is estimated to have slowed from an annual increase of 19 percent in 1995 to less than 5 percent in the first half of 1996, relative to the first half of 1995." The overall slowdown appeared to be largely the result of reduced demand from consumers in Western Europe and North America and was affecting not only those two regions but also Latin America and Asia, according to the report. Another cause was a decline in the rate of trade expansion in booming Asian states, long an engine for the world economy, although these countries were expected to maintain an overall increase of nearly 10 percent, twice the global average. A key factor affecting the value of trade was the fluctuating rate of the dollar, on which most trade calculations are based, against other major currencies, the report said. The report said the trade growth slowdown was especially marked in Western European countries, with the exception of Britain, both in exports and imports. In North America, import growth had dropped sharply to less than 5 percent, largely due to a major contraction in Canadian purchases of foreign goods. But the slowdown in merchandise exports from the region was "relatively moderate" due to the continued strength of U.S. sales abroad. "Very sharp" deceleration of import growth was reported for South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and especially for Japan, where growth was only 3.5 percent in the first six months of the year compared with 12.5 percent for all of 1995. Growth in exports from Japan, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong was negative in the first half of the year. But in South Korea and Hong Kong it remained in the double-digit range, although lower than in 1995, the report said.
ECAT	Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Wednesday that his centre-left government has created the conditions for long-term economic growth. "In this last year of work, we have created authentic preconditions for an economic growth that is not transitory," Prodi said in a speech to a construction industry congress. Prodi said Italy's low inflation and deficit-cutting measures had set the stage for a programme of economic recovery. "Now that we have overcome the most critical phase of the economic cycle and decisively started to get public spending in order, we can think of a serious programme of economic recovery," he said. Italy's inflation in June stood at 1.4 percent. The government's inflation target for 1997 is an average 2.5 percent, but ministers say the final figure should be well below that. Prodi said he believed the economic programme would also boost the construction industry and said the government was studying the possibility of providing more tax incentives for the sector. --Rome newsroom +396-678-2501
GCAT	The ancient Czech capital has suffered invasions of dictators and demonstrators but nothing and no-one so extraordinary as Michael Jackson and his cohorts. The controversial and self-styled "King of Pop" plays his first concert in two years when the "HiStory" world tour starts on Saturday on Prague's Letna Plain, where Communist leaders once reviewed troops and Pope John Paul II held mass. On Tuesday, Jackson is expected to receive the kind of welcome usually reserved for heads of state when his jet lands at Prague's VIP terminal and he is wisked away in a Rolls Royce. This tour is Jackson's first since he was cleared of child molestation charges by a U.S. court because of lack of evidence. Like Britain's Queen Elizabeth in May, he will get a full police escort through the ancient Czech capital, but not even monarchs can compete with the huge fleet of luxury cars readied to carry the star's entourage. Police have asked Czechs to stay away from the airport, but officials have encouraged well-wishers to come out and wave along the 15 km (10 mile) route into the city. Jackson's Prague date has avoided the controversy at other stops on his three-month tour through Europe, Africa and Asia. In South Korea, civic and religious groups reacted bitterly to a decision to let Jackson play two concerts in Seoul in October, saying it was unbelievable that the government agreed to to make an "amoral singer" the teenagers' idol. A planned stop in Casablanca was cancelled by Moroccan authorities, without explanation. A concert organiser said the government did not want 100,000 youths all in the same place. Jackson's Prague promoter, Serge Grimaux, said the normally reclusive Jackson wanted to arrive several days before the concert to mix with the thousands who throng the bridges and palaces of the Bohemian capital "like a normal tourist". "He has a big interest in meeting people and doesn't want to be too incognito," Grimaux told reporters. For those who don't see enough of Jackson, organisers are planning to erect a 10-metre (33 foot) water-filled statue of the singer on the same rock platform hovering above Prague where a monument to Soviet-leader Josef Stalin once stood. Never before has the sprawling parade ground adjacent to Prague Castle prepared for a spectacle like the one planned for the expected 130,000 paying guests on Saturday. Huge walls for two security perimeters -- to keep out those not paying the $21 for a ticket -- are being built on the Letna grounds which usually host ball fields, car parks, and a major east-west thoroughfare. "I'm not building Alcatraz, I'm just building a perimeter for the people that have paid for their tickets to get what they deserve," Grimaux said.
GCAT	India said on Thursday that its opposition to a global nuclear test ban treaty did not mean New Delhi intended to enter into an arms race with neighbouring Pakistan and China. Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral was asked at a news conference if India's decision to block adoption of the accord in Geneva would lead to an arms race with Pakistan and China. "I do not see that possibility because India is not entering into any arms race," he said. "Our not signing a new treaty does not mean we are going in for any new kind of weapons, particularly nuclear." China, along with Britain, France, Russia and the United States, is a declared nuclear power. India carried out a nuclear test in 1974 but says it has not built the bomb. Experts believe both India and Pakistan could quickly assemble nuclear weapons. Asked what stopped India from being an open nuclear power state Gujral said "self-discipline." Gujral said he did not expect India's veto of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) to damage bilateral ties with the United States or other nations. "We both value each other's friendship and this one issue on which we may differ should not affect and will not affect our bilateral relations," Gujral said. But Gujral said India would re-examine its position if the treaty was modified. Asked what India would do if the pact were forwarded to the United Nations General Assembly, Gujral said: "That bridge I will cross when I come to it." In a written statement released at the news conference, Gujral reiterated India's objections to the treaty, under negotiation at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. "It is a sad fact that the nuclear weapon states show no interest in giving up their nuclear hegemony," the statement said. Gujral said India had national security concerns that made it impossible for New Delhi to sign the CTBT. "Our security concerns oblige us to maintain our nuclear option," he said, adding that India had exercised restraint in not carrying out any nuclear tests since the country's lone test blast in 1974. He said: "We cannot accept constraints on our option as long as nuclear weapon states continue to rely on their nuclear arsenals for their security".
CCAT	Maxus Energy Corp, U.S. unit of Argentina's YPF SA, will form a natural gas joint venture with Amoco Corp, YPF's executive vice president and CEO Robert Monti was quoted Friday as saying. "The goal is to sign the agreement in July," Monti said according to El Cronista newspaper. "There will be a board formed by two Maxus and two Amoco representatives to approve the main decisions." El Cronista said Maxus and Amoco would have each a 50 percent participation in the new firm that will operate in Panhandle gas fields of Texas.  The gas output would be split in half and each company would sell it separately, it added. Monti said YPF will pay this year $2.0 billion in taxes and royalties, the newspaper added. The company was privatized in 1992. The state still has a 20 percent stake and its employees an additional 10 percent. Monti said "those stakes could be sold this year, but that decision does not belong to us." According to Clarin newspaper Monti said YPF "favors an atomized (shares) distribution and is against a sale in block." ((--Guillermo Haskel, Buenos Aires Newsroom, 541 318-0650))
CCAT	Hopewell Holdings Ltd has raised toll charges on phase one of its China highway linking Shenzhen-Guangzhou-Zhuhai but did not think that would affect usage, a senior company official said on Tuesday. Toll charges for the 122-km phase one Shenzhen-Guangzhou stretch was raised by 25 percent to HK$0.50 per kilometre/tonne on September 15, project controller Alan Chan told reporters. But the higher fee was not likely to affect usage, currently estimated at 60,000 vehicles per day, Chan said. The official opening of the phase one stretch is slated for October. -- HONG KONG NEWSROOM (852) 2843-6441
GCAT	The extratropical remains of Dale will race eastward through the northern West Pacific Ocean, crossing the dateline in about 36 hours as a powerful storm system, threatening shipping.   Tropical Storm Ernie is moving southwestward across the South China Sea and is expected to make landfall with top winds near 50 mph in Vietnam in 18-24 hours. The main threat from this storm will be from heavy rain and flooding once the storm reaches land. This is some risk to shipping due to squalls prior to landfall.   There are no further statements at this time.
CCAT	U.S. Robotics Corp. stock jumped to its highest level in more than a month Thursday as expectations grew that the company would have a faster modem on the market by the end of the year. The Skokie, Ill.-based developer of communications products and systems told an Oppenheimer & Co. investors conference Tuesday that it is looking at developing new technologies including higher speed modems. U.S. Robotics stock rose $4.875 to $61.67 on the Nasdaq system. The fastest speed for modems in the market currently stands at 33.6 kilobits per second. The consumer modems now being sold are typically 28.8 kilobits per second. Although U.S. Robotics will not comment on whether it is, in fact, close to shipping a 56 kilobits bits per second modem, analysts think the company will be quicker to ship a faster modem than Rockwell International Corp.'s semiconductor unit, which said earlier this week that it expects to demonstrate 56 kilobit transmission capabilities at a trade show in November. "My sense is (U.S. Robotics) probably (will ship by) the end of this year, but I think the others will take a little longer," said Amar Senan, an analyst at Volpe, Welty. John Grangaard, an analyst at GS2 Securities, said this could give U.S. Robotics months of lead time on its competition. "I'm expecting U.S. Robotics to have a product in the fourth calendar quarter," he said. "They could have anything from a six to 12 months lead time on the competition." Rockwell rose 50 cents to $54.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.

MCAT	Indonesian tyre-grade SIR20 rubber prices were stable in late trading on Tuesday, with Michelin heard buying end-October shipments, traders said. "Michelin bought about 600 tonnes from several parties today at 98.25 cents/kg for end-October shipment," one trader said, adding that it was probably the SIR20 M grade, which had a slight premium over the regular SIR20 C grade. "I didn't want to sell at that price because it was not to my liking," he said. The traders also said news of high stock levels in Thailand kept the market quiet, with most other buyers staying sidelined in anticipation of weaker prices. They said that a Thai industry official who attended a gathering of regional rubber produers on the tourist island of Bali over the weekend had told the meeting that Thailand had stock levels of about 140,000 tonnes. "It was not clear if the amount was stocks waiting to be sold or excess stocks, but the news saw buyers withdrawing from the market," one said. "Buyers were present at the meeting." Traders were unanimous that the news would dampen market sentiment, adding that prices could weaken on Wednesday. "I am puzzled at why the Thai official revealed such a sensitive thing at a meeting where buyers were present," one trader said. "Buyers are obviously going to be sidelined because of the large amount of rubber available in the market." Another trader said the annoucement could affect the Indonesian market, where buyers were already scarce. "The Indonesian market will be hit. It was a wrong move, especially at a time when the market is depressed." Traders said September SIR20 offers were quoted at 44.00 cents/lb fob Medan, 43.75-44.00 cents fob Palembang and Surabaya, 43.75 cents fob Padang and 43.00 cents fob Pontianak and Jambi. -- Jakarta newsroom + 6221 384-6364
GCAT	Extradition proceedings will begin next June for a former Thai bank official arrested in Canada on fraud charges, a Canadian court ruled on Wednesday. Rakesh Saxena, a former treasury advisor to the struggling Bangkok Bank of Commerce, was arrested near Vancouver in July by Canadian and Thai police. At a brief preliminary hearing on Wednesday, the British Columbia Supreme Court ruled that Saxena's extradition case would be heard from June 2 to 13 next year. Saxena, 45, is currently free on bail in Vancouver and has already appeared several times in court for bond and procedural matters. An Indian national and resident of Thailand, he is accused of colluding with a group of bank executives to embezzle $63.3 million. He has denied the charges. Saxena, who was an independent treasury advisor to the bank, was granted bail following his arrest on the condition that he post $1.25 million Canadian ($909,000 U.S.) in bond and surrender his passport. The Thai government took control of the Bangkok bank in May after it faced a public run on deposits. The country's central bank has said that Bangkok Bank of Commerce has more than $3 billion of bad, risky and non-performing loans.

GCAT	Free agent point guard Kenny Smith, a member of two NBA championship teams with the Houston Rockets, will join the Detroit Pistons Tuesday. A team spokesman said the Pistons have called a news conference for Tuesday afternoon to announce the signing of Smith, who played last season for the Rockets. No terms were disclosed. The 31-year-old Smith spent the last six seasons with Houston but the Rockets renounced his rights after last season when he averaged 8.5 points and 3.6 assists per game. Smith previously played for the Sacramento Kings and Atlanta Hawks. He has averaged 13.2 points and 5.7 assists in his nine-year career. Smith recently said he would like to play for Detroit because he would have a chance to compete for the starting job. Lindsey Hunter is the incumbent point guard, averaging 8.5 points and 2.4 assists last season. Smith was the starting point guard on Houston's championship teams in 1994 and 1995 but his scoring average has declined in each of the last five seasons. The signing of Smith would be the fifth of the off-season for the Pistons. They have re-signed free agents Otis Thorpe, Don Reid and Michael Curry and signed free agent Rick Mahorn away from the New Jersey Nets. Detroit, which lost scoring guard Allan Houston to the New York Knicks through free agency and was unable to sign free agent centre Dikembe Mutombo, dealt four draft picks to the Atlanta Hawks for forwards Stacey Augmon and Grant Long.
MCAT	HSBC Markets said its Hong Kong bond index rose to 120.00 in October, a 1.69 percent increase over September. The sub-index for Hong Kong government paper increased by 1.71 percent, while the sub-index for non-Hong Kong government paper rose by 1.69 percent. Compared with levels at end-October 1995, the overall index increased by 8.6 percent, the sub-index for Hong Kong government paper rose by 7.2 percent and the sub-index for non-Hong Kong government paper increased by 9.5 percent. Hong Kong markets appeared to adopt the view in October that relatively weak U.S. economic data and the upcoming presidential election would convince the Federal Reserve to keep rates unchanged for the rest of 1996, HSBC said. This, combined with the steepness of the Hong Kong dollar yield curve and ample liquidity in the market, resulted in a downward shift of the local yield curve in October, it said. HSBC Markets said buying interest in the longer end of the market was reflected by the strong response to the debut issue of the 10-year Exchange Fund Note on October 28, which was 13.5 times oversubscribed. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843-6371
GCAT	Explosives are by far the most popular weapons among American right-wing extremists, mainly because their components are cheap and readily available, criminal statistics show. In a study due to be published next month by the Klanwatch Project of the Southern Poverty Law Centre, attorney Brian Levin said explosives-related arrests accounted for 22 percent of criminal incidents involving extremists recorded during a two-year period that ended in December 1996. The next most common incidents were threats at 15 percent, followed by failure to comply with tax or environmental laws at 12 percent; nonexplosive-weapons offences at 10 percent; larceny and fraud, also at 10 percent; and premeditated assaults on police or government systems at 8.5 percent. Spontaneous confrontations with police, such as shootouts that resulted from traffic stops, represented 5 percent of extremist incidents. Armed robberies, armed standoffs and the use of poisons or pathogens also stood at 5 percent. Levin, who heads the Centre on Hate and Extremism at Richard Stockton College in Pomona, N.J., said the statistics reflected the behaviour of what he called the "Patriot" movement. "It's a broad, political and social movement, which occurs along a spectrum. On the more moderate side of the spectrum you have libertarians, nonviolent fundamentalists and single-issue proponents, such as anti-abortion activists" he told Reuters. "On the more extreme side of the scale you have violent constitutionalists and ultra-fundamentalist racist zealots. There's a broad spectrum, and the vast majority of this movement is not pro-violence." According to Levin, extremists who take to violence choose explosives not only because of the low cost but also because of easy access to bomb-making instructions available in pamphlets and on the Internet computer network. "These people really think that they're in a guerrilla war. And for someone who's on a mission to really undermine the government and to induce chaos, which is what they're trying to do, explosives are just about the most effective means -- second only to toxins and pathogens," he said.
MCAT	The State (central) Bank of Pakistan said on Monday it had raised interest rates on five-year maturity foreign currency bearer certificates. The bank said the rate for the dollar certificate had been increased to 9.0 percent from 8.75 percent, the pound sterling certificates to 9.75 percent from 9.25 percent and the deutsche mark certificates to 7.25 percent from 6.75 percent. Interest on the yen certificate will be unchanged at 4.0 percent, the bank said. -- Karachi newsroom 9221-5685192
CCAT	Randgold and Exploration Co Ltd's gold results were knocked into loss in the second quarter but the group said on Monday it refused to lie down and its gold mines were better off now than five years ago. "If I've ever had a a tougher three months in my business career, I can't remember when that was," Randgold chairman Peter Flack told a June- quarter gold results presentation. "We're bloodied, a little bowed, but we're not about to give up," he said. Randgold's seven gold mines together made a pre-capex cash loss of 40.95 million rand ($9 million) for the second quarter compared to a 54.99 million rand profit in the preceding quarter. With the exception of Harmony Gold Mining Co Ltd, which produced a steady performance, the Randgold mines were hit by production problems and a weak gold price. "Harmony succeeded in producing another steady performance in the June quarter during which the combined effects of production problems and a low gold price took their toll on the other Randgold mines' results," the group said in a statement. But Flack added that, East Rand Proprietary Mines Ltd aside, the group's mines were better off than before. "With the possible exception of ERPM...they are in a much better state now than at any time in the last three to five years," he said. ERPM last week announced that the current low gold price and lower than expected underground yields created a strong possibility that it could cease operations in the near future. Flack said that the other six mines had clearer operating strategies, better management and "money in the bank". "Although suffering from the current gold price, they are not about to fade away," he said. Turning to the West Rand Mines -- Durban Roodepoort Deep Ltd, Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mining Co Ltd and Buffelsfontein Gold Mines Ltd -- chairman Roger Kebble said that results were very poor but that action was being taken and profits could be seen by September. "We are taking action with regard to the future of these operations. These figures are historical and all is not lost. We should start seeing working profits by September this years." Second-quarter gold output for the West Rand Mines fell 13 percent to 4.5 tonnes, while costs increased 11 percent to 275.4 million rand, resulsting in an overall cash loss of 34.8 million rand from a previous profit of 28 million rand. He said that the West Rand Mines were replanning their capital expenditure to preserve their cash position in the face of the current weak gold price. Kebble said the West Rand Mine merger was on track with new shares and options due to be listed on September 15. ERPM extended its second quarter loss slightly to 12.14 million rand from a previous loss of 11.14 million rand. ERPM managing director Ivan Vidulich said that while there was the possibility of reducing costs further in the third quarter, this would still not reach the margins hoped for. Steady performer Harmony made a pre-capex cash profit in the quarter of 35.16 million rand from 39.59 million rand previously, increasing gold output to 5,543 kg from 5,479 kg. "We have a strong enough balance sheet to know that we will be able to survive the next four to six quarters. We're well positioned to continue our growth strategy," said Harmony managing director Bernard Swanepoel. -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482-1003 ($ = 4.571 South African Rand)

GCAT	Top U.S. military officer General John Shalikashvili on Monday began a visit to China aimed at improving Sino-U.S. military ties, frozen when Chinese soldiers crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989. Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, was the most senior U.S. military officer to visit China since 1983. He received a warm but rain-soaked welcome at Beijing's Capital Airport from officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) led by Major-General Luo Bin, director general of the Defence Ministry's Foreign Affairs Bureau. Shalikashvili was scheduled to meet his Chinese counterpart General Fu Quanyou and to visit military facilities and units during his four-day visit. He will also speak to the PLA's National Defence University. U.S. officials have said the trip is aimed at strengthening ties and increasing understanding and transparency between the world's most powerful military and its most heavily manned. A number of Western countries have recently moved to improve military relations with the three-million strong PLA that were effectively frozen in 1989 when soldiers crushed student-led pro-democracy protests in Beijing with heavy loss of life. Shalikashvili's visit was the latest in a series by senior U.S. officials to China. The visits have helped to fuel a warming in the cross-Pacific relationship, long strained by disputes over issues ranging from human rights to trade to Taiwan.

ECAT	The world's top trade mandarins trumpeted signs of early progress on Monday toward a multi-billion dollar pact for free world commerce in information technology but wrangling over cheap labour threatened a final consensus. Trade ministers from the 128 members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) opened their first Ministerial Conference with speeches underlining the gulf dividing North from South on such issues as low wages and transparency in government procurement and North from North on removing tariffs on information technology. But while the ministers sought ways to boost world trade and described commerce as a dynamic stimulus to create jobs worldwide, the WTO issued a survey that showed growth in goods trade slowing sharply by three percentage points to five percent in 1996. Many eyes focused on the most contentious emerging issue -- Washington's battle to use international trade rules to raise Third World labour standards, eradicate sweat shops and stop an estimated 250 million children working. Singapore's Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong pulled no punches in warning the big powers not to push the emerging economies too hard to reduce some of their distinctive advantages. "It is clear that low labour costs are a legitimate comparative advantage for developing countires and that labour standards should not be used as a disguised protectionist measure," he said in his inaugural address to the week-long conference of the Geneva-based organisation. The United States, backed by France and Canada, wants the issue to be thrashed out at the WTO. "We believe strongly that increased trade and economic growth that it brings should also engender greater respect for the basic human rights which are the focus of our core labour standards proposal," Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said. India, Indonesia and Malaysia, among others, want no mention of labour in the final document that the WTO wants to adopt by close of business on Friday. And the WTO operates by consensus. "We do not see any purpose in bringing this subject into the WTO except possibly to use trade measures to enforce labour standards," Indian Commerce Minister B.B. Ramaiah said. A string of Western nations also threw their weight against the United States. British, Australian and German trade ministers all said the WTO meeting was not the place to resolve the issue. They agreed with the Asians that the International Labour Organisation, which deals with standards in the workplace, was the right place to handle the admitted problems in developing nations. With haggling over labour standards, government procurement, investment and competition and agriculture set to persist through the week after a reorganisation of the schedule, delegates were making a major push to wrap up a deal that would eliminate tariffs on a wide range of information technology. WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero urged the two-year-old body to agree on key issues despite their political sensitivity. The draft Information Technology Agreement (ITA), which seeks to scrap tariffs on an estimated $1 trillion worth of annual world trade in computer and telecommunications products, was critical. "In the economy of the 21st Century, knowledge, like water, will be an essential resource," Ruggiero said. Barshefsky, who hopes to make the ITA the crowning achievement of the meeting, and European Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan met to try to thrash out their differences over the types of products that would be covered by the agreement. Barshefsky argued that an ITA would help businesses become more competitive in the global economy by putting lower-cost equipment and information into their hands. "That's why we must reach an agreement this week," she said. "We have an historic opportunity to eliminate tariffs on these products. We must seize it." While efforts to strike a deal shifted into high gear, it was uncertain whether the ministers would be successful. Japanese officials warned that consensus on a working document was needed by Wednesday if a final declaration was to be ready by Friday. "From early morning to late in the evening, we are making efforts," a Japanese trade official told reporters. "I think that a lot of momentum has emerged." Developing countries want more flexibility on the timetable and Singapore's Goh told reporters: "I think there will be an agreement but not an agreement on zero tariffs by 2000."
CCAT	Starbucks Corp stock fell on Thursday after the company reported weaker-than-expected sales for October, the first month of its fiscal year. Starbucks said same-store sales for the four weeks ending October 27 rose 5 percent, compared with 7 percent for the fiscal year that ended September 29. Company executives have been telling analysts to anticipate same-store sales growth in the "mid-single digits" for the year, but "I was expecting at least 7 percent," said Diane Daggatt, an analyst at Dain Bosworth. Starbuck shares were down 2-1/4 at 32-3/4.   Analysts said sales growth may have slowed in October because of the end of a strong summer season for the company's cold Frappuccino beverages. Daggatt said "specialty" sales of coffee to large institutional customers, which can swing widely from month to month, were comparatively slow in October. Analyst Jean-Michel Valette of Hambrecht & Quist said revenues were boosted in October 1995 by a sale of espresso machines, while a 25th anniversary promotion this month apparently was not as successful. Starbucks said overall revenues in October rose 43 percent to $63 million, compared with $44 million in October 1995, down from the 50 percent growth rate seen in the fiscal year that just ended. Valette estimated percentage revenue growth in the current fiscal year would be in the "low-40s." -- Reuters Seattle bureau 206-386-4848
CCAT	Office Depot Inc, which earlier announced a definitive agreement to merge with Staples Inc, said Wednesday its third quarter earnings are being impacted by a general softness in sales in August and earnings may come in below analysts' projections. The company said it expects sales may increase in September when it sends its Fall catalog to customers. "If sales trends do not increase from currently expected levels, however, earnings for the third quarter could be in the range of $0.20 - $0.21 per share," the company said. The First Call consensus for the quarter is $0.25. "While our third quarter may come in below analysts' projections, Office Depot still anticipates that our fourth quarter results will be in line with analyst expectations of $0.26 per share," it said. "Not only are our sales historically stronger in the fourth quarter, but the company should also benefit from continued sales growth and expense control within our Business Services Division." -- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610.

ECAT	The lingering logjam that has stalled construction projects important to every part of Massachusetts appears to have been broken with news that plans for a new convention center in Boston are finally advancing, State House News reported. House Speaker Thomas Finneran is reportedly convinced that the latest scheme to finance a $700 million convention facility in Boston is more reasonable than those of the past, and will not sap the state budget or consume money needed for other capital projects. A hearing on the Boston bill is scheduled for Monday before the State Administration Committee and Gov. William Weld is expected to testify. The same committee was urged by the Weld administration on Wednesday to advance similar capital projects for other parts of the state. For the past two years, it has been understood that in order to garner legislative votes for a Boston convention center, economic development projects in other regions would also have to move. Lt. Gov. Paul Cellucci pushed for all of the projects. Boston, San Francisco and New Orleans are the most desirable sites for major conventions, Boston is unable to handle the larger ones, Cellucci said. "The Boston Convention Center piece has been structured in such a way that it won't have much of impact on the bond cap," Cellucci told legislators. "Our plan for a Boston Convention Center won't reduce the General Fund at all - because we propose a revenue financing structure without significant use of general obligation bond proceeds," he said.  "That means there will be money within the $900 million bond cap for Worcester, Springfield, Fall River and Berkshire County projects.  And that  means the entirecommonwealth will get the maximum benefit from the legislation that has been filed to get the convention center. "Gov. Weld and I believe that Worcester needs a convention center, Springfield needs the Basketball Hall of Fame, Berkshire County needs the National Music Center, and Fall River needs a revitalized Kerr Mill site, just as badly as the city of Boston needs its convention center," he said. The bill heard Wednesday provides $17 million for the Worcester Convention Center expansion, already underway and scheduled for completion in September. The project is designed to attract more conventions, tourists and jobs to the city. The National Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield would get a $25 million boost under terms of the bill. The existing riverfront site would be enhanced by a retail development and by construction of what Cellucci called a "state-of-the-art, multimedia exhibit hall with interactive displays that will let every kid find out what it's like to play one-on-one with Michael Jordan." The bill also provides $2.5 million for the National Music Center in Berkshire County. Another $3.5 million would be used to develop the Kerr Mill site in downtown Fall River. "Long ago, textile mills were the backbone of the Fall River economy, and now these buildings may become the backbone of that economy again," the lieutenant governor said.

CCAT	Cox Communications Inc and TCI Communications Inc said Thursday they have completed a deal trading cable television systems that serve about 600,000 customers. Under the deal, each company will receive about 300,000 new customers in areas that are "contiguous or advantageous to" locations where the companies already have a "significant presence," the companies said in a statement. TCI will receive Cox's systems in the greater Pittsburgh area; Spokane, Wash.; Springfield, Ill.; Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and the Quad Cities area of Illinois and Iowa; and Saginaw, Mich. Cox will receive TCI's systems in Bellevue/LaVista, Neb.; Council Bluffs, Iowa; Chesapeake, Va.; Scottsdale, Ariz.; North Attleboro/Taunton, Mass.; Lincoln, R.I.; and St. Bernard, La.

ECAT	Australian Prime Minister John Howard said on Thursday official data still indicated that the Australian economy was likely to grow at about 3.5 percent over the coming year. "All of the official advice coming to the government is that the economy will grow at a rate of about 3.5 percent over the coming year," Howard told Sydney radio 2GB.   In the government's mid-year budget review, released in late January, Treasurer Peter Costello forecast economic growth of 3.5 percent in both 1996/97 and 1997/98. Howard also said retailers had indicated a change in Australian consumers' spending patterns with more being spent after the Christmas period than in the past. "There is some indication from the comments of some of the major retailers that people are now spending proportionately more immediately after Christmas than they used to spend in the past," Howard said.   Earlier this month, Howard said the latest retail trade figures were consistent with government's mid-year budget review forecasts. Australian retail sales fell 1.0 percent in December and dropped 1.3 percent in real terms over the three months to December. -- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730
CCAT	Kvaerner ASA said on Friday it planned to launch one month ahead of schedule the floating storage unit (FSU) for the Norwegian Njord oil development. Njord, which lies in the Haltenbank area off mid-Norway in the Norwegian Sea, is due to start production in October. "We will launch the unit sometime tonight," Toivo Ilvonen, project manager at Kvaerner's Masa-Yards Turku shipyard in Finland, told Reuters. He said the unit, once afloat, would undergo commissioning and outfitting work before being sailed for delivery in June, when it will be towed to the field and anchored in 330 metres (1,083 ft) of water. A spokeswoman for operator Norsk Hydro ASA said that despite the early completion of the FSU, the whole project was still on schedule for October. "We also have the production unit and wells etc. Njord is still planned for October," she said. The FSU has a storage capacity of 112,000 cubic metres of oil -- corresponding to about 10 days production. The unit is designed for 15 years of continuous operation and a fatigue life of the hull for 25 years. --Oslo newsroom, +47 22 42 50 41
CCAT	Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel has sought alterations in plans to privatise Etibank, a key part of the government's privatisation programme and revenue-raising strategy, privatisation officials said on Wednesday. "The president has not signed the Etibank decree. He has asked for some more details," a Privatisation Administration (OIB) official told Reuters. Privatisation sources say Demirel opposed plans to create two new banks by dividing Etibank into three. Turkey's decade-old privatisation programme has been stalled repeatedly by legal challenges and political opposition. The three-month old coalition government of Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan has targeted privatisation as vital to a planned $10 billion resource package. Turkey is in desperate need of fresh revenues to combat gaping deficits. The sell-off programme has so far raised around $3.1 billion, with annual revenues repeatedly well below government targets, analysts say. Etibank, expected by some analysts to raise around $100-150 million, was given priority by Erbakan ahead of other major privatisation projects. The Etibank decree had envisaged creating one national bank and two regional ones. The sell-off of the programme's centrepiece, Turk Telekom, along with major companies such as Petkim, Tupras and Petrol Ofisi is unlikely to be pushed through in the near term, analysts said. Privatisation of smaller companies continues to advance slowly. Turkey's cement plants were sold off earlier this year and the government is currently seeking bids for the sale of state-owned tyre manufacturer Petlas Lastik Sanayi A.S. -- Ankara Newsroom, +90-312-446 2940
GCAT	RAWALPINDI, Nov 29 - Concentration is the key to combating Pakistani legspinner Mushtaq Ahmed, according to New Zealand cricketer Stephen Fleming. The elegant Canterbury batsman yesterday defied Mushtaq for 208 minutes as he stroked his way to 67 to help the Kiwis reach 215 for eight on the opening day of the second test here at Pindi Stadium. For Fleming, yesterday's knock was heartwarming as it followed his superb unbeaten 92 which played a predominant role in New Zealand's 44-run victory in the first test in Lahore earlier this week.   He and captain Lee Germon rescued the tourists with a defiant eighth-wicket stand of 81 after they had been in serious trouble at 111 for seven an hour after lunch. He was in immaculate touch against all the Pakistani bowlers yesterday, including Mushtaq who claimed five for 76 to pick up his seventh five-wicket haul in 26 tests. Mushtaq also took his career tally into three figures when he accounted for his first victim yesterday, opener Bryan Young, who was given out leg before wicket when he tried to sweep after reaching 39.   Fleming said no one could ever feel at ease against Mushtaq, who is rated among the top three legspinners in the world, alongside Australia's Shane Warne and Anil Kumble, of India. "Each ball from him can get you out. He has so many variations that you constantly have to be looking for everything," 23-year-old Fleming said. "Maybe my concentration wasn't quite right when I missed his googly and got a wee nick to it. "I thought I had been picking most of his googlies, but you can never be sure because one can sneak through that you can't quite get."   Fleming said concentration was not difficult yesterday because of the regular departure of his colleagues at the other end. "Concentrating wasn't tough out there, not when you are losing wickets. "When that's happening, it's always a motivation to keep going because you know how important it is for you to stay there." New Zealand coach Steve Rixon could do with more batsmen in Fleming's form.   "He is very committed at the moment. He's really on song and it's just great to have some solidarity in the middle order," Rixon said.

MCAT	The dollar recovered from troughs against the mark and yen in late Europe after ambling sideways in narrow dealings, the market subdued by a UK bank holiday. "There is not much going on. The markets are very quiet and we are stuck in small ranges," said a trader at a German bank. At 1314 GMT dollar/mark was trading at 1.7294/99, off early lows around 1.7260 marks, and steady against 1.7294 marks in late Europe on Friday. The dollar regained composure against a generally robust mark in afternoon Europe as the German unit lost some of its momentum against its European satellites.   Against the yen, the dollar recovered from lows to stand at 126.56/61 in late Europe, unchanged on morning levels around 126.57/6.67 yen and 126.65 yen in late Europe on Friday. Overall, the dollar was in good shape after the release of Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls and news of a government agreement to balance the budget by 2002, said traders. "Should equity market euphoria continue this week and propel the Dow to all-time highs, dollar/mark and dollar/yen may be dragged higher," said Nick Parsons, forex strategist at Banque Paribas. Elsewhere, sterling recovered momentum against the mark after an early dip lower.   At 1330 GMT stg/mark was trading at 2.8010/20 against session lows of 2.7975 and late Friday's 2.8052 marks. Sterling markers remain attentive as the new Labour government under Prime Minister Tony Blair began its first full week of power. Markets are focused on Wednesday's UK monetary meeting between new Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown and Bank of England Governor Eddie George, amid speculation Brown will sanction the interest rate rise the BoE has long been urging. "The main currency to watch is sterling," said the trader at the German bank. --Julia Meehan, London newsroom +4471 542 6701
GCAT	Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole on Wednesday criticised the entertainment industry for glorifying drug use and unveiled a new anti-drug slogan -- "Just say don't do it." Speaking at a Catholic prep school that uses drug-sniffing dogs to help keep the campus drug-free, Dole sought to reignite a public crusade against drug use as well as his own struggling campaign. "I have a message to the fashion, music and film industries," he said. "Take your influence seriously, you have a lot of it. Respect your talent and power. Stop the commercialization of drug abuse. Stop the glorification of slow suicide." The speech was the latest salvo in Dole's effort to win votes with an anti-drugs, anti-crime programme launched on Monday in Philadelphia. The entertainment and fashion industries shared in the responsibility for shaping attitudes among teenagers, whose rates of drug use have more than doubled since 1992, Dole said. "The marijuana leaf and the heroin needle have become the symbols of fashionable rebellion, and two of the most widely praised movies of the past two years, 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Trainspotting' feature the romance of heroin," he said. "Fashion magazines feature models with what is known as the 'junkie look.' Rock musicians create and celebrate a culture of heroin. And some have become role models, even in death," he said. Dole has seen neither "Trainspotting," about Scottish heroin addicts living in squalor, or "Pulp Fiction," about American heroin addicts living the fast life, Dole spokesman Nelson Warfield said. But he has read reviews of both films, including one citing "Trainspotting" as a "funny, upbeat look at herion addiction," Warfield said. Dole criticised President Bill Clinton for sowing "moral confusion" by making light of his own past, non-inhaling, expermentation with marijuana -- citing an MTV music television interview in which Clinton said he would inhale marijuana if given another chance. He harkened back to the 1980's anti-drug campaign of former first lady Nancy Reagan, with its slogan "Just say no," in leading the students in his new slogan, "Just don't do it." The line also evokes Nike's shoe slogan, "Just do it." Dole also received the endorsement of the 7,000-member California Narcotics Officers Association, a another shot in the law-and-order endorsement battle with Clinton, who snared the backing of the 270,000 member Fraternal Order of Police. Dole has criticised the entertainment industry before for contributing to a moral decline in America, but in July he cast his goals for the industry in a postitive light, going to California to thank filmmakers for several uplifting movies. That was in recognition of the industry's importance in California, the largest state in terms of electoral votes.
MCAT	Singapore stocks open steady early Monday with China linked stocks rallying on the back of the euphoria over the Hong Kong handover, said dealers. Newly-listed Tianjin Zhongxin Pharmaceutical  TIAN.SI hit a high of US$1.17, up 14 cents, before settling back to US$1.14 after an hour of trading. Volume was an active 14.4 million shares. China North Industrial also rose to a new 1997 high of US$0.61, up four cents with 1.64 million traded. HongKong Land Holdings also gained eight cents to US$2.68 on active volume. But the broader marekt was lacklustre despite some light bargin hunting after Friday's sell-off, said dealers. The Straits Times Industrials Index (STI) rose 5.94 points to 1,980.31 after about an hour of activity. "The STI will try to push towards 2,000 and if that fails, we will be drifting lower," a dealer with a foreign brokerage said. There were 59 gainers against 79 losers and volume was a light 42.2 million units. The bounce in the STI was attributed to a rebound in Cycle & Carriage, a major component of the index, which rose to Singapore $14.50, up 10 cents, and Metro Holdings, at S$4.66, up 14 cents. Dealers said trade was thinned by a four-day closure of the Hong Kong stock exchange-- Jacqueline Wong (65 8703080).
MCAT	Canadian bonds closed mixed on Tuesday as long bonds followed U.S. treasuries lower, with the market focused on Wednesday's testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, analysts said. "We really have no volume. I think essentially it's just dealers marking the prices down with the U.S.," said David Yu, a fixed-income portfolio manager with Perigee Investment Counsel Inc. "Nobody really wants to do much because tomorrow Mr. Greenspan will be speaking." Canada's 30-year bond fell C$0.10 to C$112.85 to yield 6.929 percent.   The U.S. 30-year benchmark bond fell 1/32 to yield 6.66 percent. The spread between the benchmark bonds was 27 basis points, unchanged from the close of trading on Monday. Canadian bonds started the session stronger, benefiting mainly from gains in U.S. treasury prices and partly from Monday's announcement by Standard & Poor's that it upgraded Canada's foreign currency debt rating outlook. But dealers said a poorly received auction of U.S. two-year bonds weighed on the U.S. market in the afternoon and spilled over to Canada.   In other prices, the Government of Canada's 7.0 percent bond due 2006 rose C$0.02 to C$105.30 to yield 6.264 percent. The U.S. 10-year bond fell 2/32 to yield 6.40 percent. The negative spread between the bonds widened to 14 basis points from 13 basis points on Monday. The three-month cash T-bill traded with a yield of 2.86 percent against the U.S. bill which yielded 5.16 percent. In Canadian new issue news, the Royal Bank said it will issue C$500 million in subordinated debentures in two tranches. The first tranche will be worth C$150 million and matures on October 12, 2009. The second tranche, worth C$350 million, matures on September 12, 2011. Volumes in Canada market were light because traders on both sides of the border are now focused on U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony Wednesday morning, during which he is expected to offer hints about the near-term direction of U.S. rates.

ECAT	A growing proportion of Lebanese industrialists reported declining production in the first half of 1996 according to a random survey by the Bank of Lebanon. The proportion of industrialists interviewed who reported a decrease in production was 34 percent in the first quarter and 41 percent in the second quarter, the Bank said in an economic trend survey. The proportion who noted an increase in their production was 28 percent in the first quarter and 24 percent in the second quarter, the survey said. Some 46 percent of the industrialists surveyed reported decreased demand in the first quarter compared with 53 percent in the second quarter, it added. Some 25 percent reported improved demand in the first quarter and 21 percent in the second. However, the volume of investments showed an upward trend in the first and second quarters "reflecting the fact that a larger proportion of industrialists keep on investing against a smaller number that have curbed their investments," the Bank said. In the commercial sector, the Bank said 47 percent of merchants interviewed in the first quarter reported a decline in sales and this rose to 59 percent in the second quaarter. The share of merchants reporting a rise in sales was 28 percent in the first quarter and 24 percent in the second quarter, the Bank said. It did not indicate the total of industrialists and merchants surveyed. -Beirut editorial (961 1) 864148 602057 353078
MCAT	Belgian government linear bonds (OLOs) will remain close to the hearts of investors, if only the domestic ones, even after a Valentine's Day rally in which OLO futures reached levels not seen before, dealers said on Friday. "There are no signals that the uptrend cannot continue," a trader said. Players were now targeting 104.00 on the March Bund future, to which OLOs are closely tied, which would equate to a yield of 5.46 percent on the benchmark 10-year cash OLO. The Bund future rose 0.43 basis points to 103.62 at 1700 GMT, outpacing in percentage terms its OLO counterpart which rose 0.47 to 123.61. Earlier the contract had peaked at 123.69.

MCAT	European trade in physical aluminium is perking along, with robust demand for Russian material keeping premiums steady, traders said. A good deal of Russian metal is continuing to bypass Europe, instead going to Asia and the United States. In addition, material that finds its way to Europe is going directly to consumers, traders said. Some traders said customers have been agreeing to take Russian A7E metal, which is deliverable on the London Metal Exchange (LME), from the Liverpool warehouse even though it is much more expensive to load and transport from there compared to the benchmark Rotterdam location, they added. "Before you might have done four lots from Liverpool, something not worth mentioning, but now you have real trade," one said. Premiums in Liverpool for Russian T-bars were said to be $4/5 per tonne above LME cash, a touch higher than before. Soon, metal may start moving from Liverpool to satisfy heated demand in the United States, where premiums had risen to 5.50 cents/lb, a trader said. But another trader said the strengthening of sterling since late last year has made shipping costs from the UK more expensive, reducing any advantage. Latest LME data shows 274,175 tonnes of aluminium in the Liverpool warehouse compared to 76,900 tonnes in Rotterdam. This compares to 297,100 tonnes and 90,875 tonnes respectively at the beginning of the year. Overall, Rotterdam premiums have remained steady, but thin trade makes them hard to pin down. Russian A0 metal, which is 99.00 percent purity, was quoted at flat to a premium of $10 over LME. This compares to flat last month and a discount of $20/25 last December. "It is nearly impossible to get tonnage of AO metal, so people are going up or down from there," one said, referring to higher or lower grades. Moving up, premiums of off-grades A5 to A7 were steady to slightly firmer, while discounts of lower 97 percent purity were quoted at $50/65 and $65/85 respectively. Quotes varied greatly, however, with one trader quoting Russian A7 metal in Rotterdam as low as $10 above LME, compared to other views of it at $25/35. Good Western duty unpaid and paid were little changed at $40/50 and $125/40 premiums. Duty paid had dipped earlier in the month but has recovered, a trader said. Another trader said duty paid should theoretically be higher, at a $145 premium. But as restocking gathers momentum and stocks fall, premiums should continue firming, he added.
MCAT	Greek and foreign commercial banks bought a total of 200 million ecus for drachmas at the central bank's fixing and ecu/drachma continued to crawl higher to 302.69 from 302.510, dealers said.   Approximate forex outflows of $400 million took place on Monday evening aggravating the liquidity shortage in the Greek money markets. Short-term money rates firmed another 20 basis points since this morning on concerns about liquidity, the unclear tax status of government securities and a crisis at the Athens bourse.   "We have an explosive mix of events that points to inadequate management at a number of governmental levels," said a dealer. "What is happening at the bourse where the government has tried to force it open today is indicative." The Association of Greek Brokers accused the government of a possible cover-up of "illegal acts" claiming it ordered state bank brokerages to resume trading at the bourse. --Dimitris Kontogiannis, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4
MCAT	Dutch shares slipped in quiet trading on Wednesday, succumbing to profit-taking ahead of a market holiday on Thursday and undermined by index-heavyweights going ex-dividend, dealers said. The AEX closed 5.77 points, 0.74 percent, down at 775.99. Dealers said the profit-taking was to be expected taken in the context of the recent sharp gains. The AEX closed on Tuesday at an all-time high of 781.76 points. A weaker bond market and a softer start to Wall Street on Wednesday encourage the selling mood although dealers said the main focus was a lack of buying interest.   "We've drifted down in line with other markets. Nobody wants to know ahead of what's a long weekend for many," a dealer said. On the coporate news front, Unilever announced it had sold its chemicals business to ICI for eight billion dollars in a move well received by the market. "The price looks good for Unilever, they've picked a good time to sell it," one said, noting the company had also said it may return the proceeds of the sale back to shareholders. The shares ended 2.50 lower at 379.50 guilders but Unilever was one of the main issues ex-dividend today.   Elsevier bucked the market trend with Tuesday's news of strategic alliance with Microsoft continuing to please investors. The shares ended up 0.50 guilders at 32.90. ASM International remained weak, losing another 3.10 guilders to close at 19.00 following a 3.80 guilder drop on Tuesday on the back of disappointing first quarter results.

ECAT	In the latest indication that Germany's economic recovery has taken root, the Economics Ministry on Tuesday said industrial orders climbed 1.5 percent in June from the month before. The figures, which were in line with private economists' forecasts, received their largest boost from west Germany, where orders increased across all manufacturing sectors. East Germany, however, continued to show weakness. "The figures help show that the economy is gaining momentum, it's on track," said Gernot Nerb, economist at Salomon Brothers in Frankfurt. West German orders rose 1.7 percent, offsetting a 3.2 percent decline in orders in the former communist east. Economists said the figures painted an especially upbeat picture for the domestic economy with pan-German domestic orders climbing 1.5 percent at the same time that foreign orders rose 1.2 percent. Consumer goods showed the most strength compared to May, rising 3.5 percent. Year-on-year, pan-German orders rose five percent in June, with west German orders up 5.2 percent and east German orders up 1.6 percent versus June 1996. The figures suggested that Bonn might yet have a fighting chance to qualify for monetary union but gave the Bundesbank little reason to raise interest rates soon, economists said. Stefan Schneider, economist at Paribas Capital Markets, said the orders data, especially coming on the back of output figures released on Monday, suggested that the economy would grow about 2.4 percent this year. Growth that strong could enable Germany to cut its budget deficit to three percent of gross domestic product and allow Bonn to qualify for monetary union, he said. With few signs of inflation in the economy, however, he and others saw little reason for the Bundesbank to raise interest rates as long as the dollar did not climb above 1.90 marks. "There are no signs that the strong dollar is feeding through into the domestic economy," Schneider said. "The Bundesbank would have a hard time selling a rate hike." In the two-month period combining orders from May and June, pan-German orders rose 5.2 percent compared to the same period last year, as the strong dollar boosted foreign orders by 12.7 percent. --Scott Miller, Bonn Newsroom 49 228 260 97150
MCAT	The Baltic Freight Index was up two points on Friday at 1,260 for its first gain since March 24. Brokers said sentiment was stronger in the London dry cargo freight market and they reported more inquiry for grains and fertilisers, particularly for Panamaxes in the Far East. Other sectors including Capers and Handysizes were quiet under the influence of the May Day in several centres this week and, in the UK, a bank holiday next Monday.
MCAT	Danish share prices closed higher in a quiet market on Monday in positive mood with more gains seen ahead as analysts digest August's stream of first-half corporate 1996 results. "It was a little like the morning after the night before now the avalanche of results is over. The market undertone is positive though, the next few days will be used by the market to mull the interim results," one dealer said. The KFX top-20 index closed 0.78 point higher at 120.29, while the KFX September future finished 0.25 point up at 120.00 with 152 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded. Overall turnover for the day was 1.092 billion crowns. Leading banks, Tele Danmark, ISS and Novo dominated the day. Den Danske Bank climbed three crowns to end at 411, while rival Unibank rose four up at 257. Tele Danmark and ISS both attracted considerable foreign investor interest, closing four and three crowns higher respectively at 286 and 152, while Novo Nordisk put on an impressive 14 crowns to finish the day at 893. A CS First Boston buy recommendation helped Danisco to climb two crowns to end at 324.
MCAT	The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) on Monday said that as of August 18, the Slovak banking sector was short of funds for fulfilling minimum reserve requirements (PMR). Peter Andresic, head of the NBS Open Market Operations department told Reuters the banking sector fulfilled the required PMR volume at 97.47 percent as of August 18. The fulfilment of minimum reserves requirement by commercial banks is one of the main NBS's yardstick for assessing money market liquidity. Monday was the first day of a new PMR period -- which lasts two weeks -- for Slovak banks. The current reserve period ends on August 31. -- Bratislava Newsroom, 421-7-521-8402
ECAT	The Colombian economy grew 2.4 percent in the third quarter compared with 3.4 percent in the same period in 1995, according to a published report, which cited preliminary figures from the National Planning Department. The figure, reported by the business newspaper La Republica Monday in advance of its official release scheduled for later in the day, is up from second quarter growth of 2.2 percent and takes the accumulated figure for the first nine months to 2.9 percent.  Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo told the specialty business paper that the result was not positive but neither was it a disaster.   He told the newspaper that it would now be very difficult to hit the 1996 growth target of 3.5 percent. The gross domestic product grew 5.2 percent in 1995. Preliminary figures obtained by La Repblica suggest growth is being driven by the service sector -- particularly on the back of greater public spending. The service sector, including public services, private education and health care, grew 10.5 percent in the third quarter, taking the consolidated figure for the first nine months to 8.5 percent. -- Karl Penhaul, Bogota newsroom, 571 610 7944
ECAT	The Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said on Thursday it saw Germany's economy turning up in the second half of 1996 and recovering into 1997 thanks to improving exports. The 27-member group, which represents the world's industrialised nations, warned Bonn that it would have to push through all its intended austerity measures if it were to ensure Germany met the Maastricht Treaty's budget deficit criterion for the single European currency. The OECD said in its annual report on Germany: "The combination of wage restraint and depreciation of the deutschemark should improve the profitability and competitiveness of German exports in the near term, although cost pressures on exports remain intense." The report was written in July, however, before the latest appreciation in the mark's value. It predicted gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 0.5 percent this year and 2.4 percent in 1997, similar to the forecasts it made in June. A year ago it predicted 2.7 percent growth for 1996. Like other forecasters, it had not expected such a severe slowdown at the turn of the year. The OECD's German representative Dieter Menke told reporters, however, that the 1996 forecast was likely to be revised upward in the autumn in the wake of stronger than expected second quarter GDP figures which came out on Thursday. The projection would probably now be a rise of between 0.5 percent and 0.75 percent this year, he said. The recovery would be too weak to have any impact on unemployment, he said, forecasting that joblessness would average 10.3 percent this year and 10.4 percent in 1997. The report forecast Germany's total public budget deficit would be 3.4 percent of GDP next year -- above the three percent required by the Maastricht treaty. But it said this forecast only included austerity measures already achieved and not those yet to come. "Strict implementation of all the austerity measures would be enough to meet the Maastricht deficit target," Menke said. He added, however, that the government's 1997 tax bill contained some tax cuts which if implemented would require savings measures over and above those contained in the austerity plan announced in April. OECD official Eckard Wurzel told Reuters that the forecast of a 3.4 percent deficit in 1997 had been reduced from a prediction of 3.6 percent made in June because Bonn had achieved a very moderate pay deal for public servants for 1997. The two officials would not be drawn on how likely they though Germany was to meet the criterion. It's deficit rose to 3.6 percent of GDP in 1995 and is likely to be close to four percent this year. Bonn's austerity package is designed to cut public spending by 50 billion marks ($33.7 billion) and social security spending by 20 billion marks next year. Finance Minister Theo Waigel says this will be sufficient to get the deficit back to 2.5 percent of GDP. But the OECD was not convinced: "Fiscal policy could be in danger of losing its credibility if existing policy commitments are not fully observed." But it applauded Bonn's structural reform drive, and urged it to go further down the same road. The tightening of fiscal policy could improve the Bundesbank's room for manoeuvre on interest rates but it would be premature and risky to recommend a strategy of linking monetary policy to fiscal policy, it said. "Monetary policy thus needs to adopt a wait-and-see posture." ($1=1.4816 Mark)
GCAT	Noise could be damaging the health of 80 million out of the European Union's 370 million people, the European Commission said on Monday. Another 170 million live in so-called "grey zones", where noise levels, while lower than in the loudest areas, still cause serious disturbances, the Commission said. The people exposed to the loudest and most prolonged dins were also generally among the poorest, it added in an anti-noise policy paper. The EU's 15 member countries face a collective bill of 12 billion European currency units ($15 billion) each year from the stress and tiredness caused by noise according to studies cited by the Commission. Noise from traffic, industry and leisure activities is one of the bloc's main environmental problems at local level and is an increasingly common source of complaint, the Commission said. It suggested better monitoring of exposure to noise and mooted the idea of future target values and associated noise reduction measures. Other ideas included the launch of an anti-noise programme for road traffic along with measures to cut the noise from vehicle tyres. Rail and air transport are also due for scrutiny, the Commission said, although at this stage only to the extent of looking at possible noise abatement options rather than specific or binding rules. The Commission will also look at the different rules in force for noisy equipment operated outside, an exercise which will involve things like diggers, compressors, pneumatic drills, welding equipment and lawnmowers. It foresees framework rules widening the scope of existing noise legislation but added that it would set noise limits only for equipment which is either already regulated or which is particularly noisy.

CCAT	The Agriculture Department said Monday it would grant a request by ConAgra Inc unit, Armour Swift-Eckrich to permit the use of sodium acetate and sodium diacetate as flavoring agents in meat and poultry products. The agency's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in a Federal Register notice that both ingredients were safe and made products more appealing to consumers. The new rule, which takes effect August 22, will allow meat and poultry processors to use sodium acetate up to 0.12 percent of the product formulation, and sodium diacetate at up to 0.1 percent of the product formulation, the agency said. Armour Swift-Eckrich asked USDA for the change in regulations so it could use the ingredients to improve the flavor of its meat and poultry products. Sodium acetate is the sodium salt of vinegar, and sodium diacetate is a blend of vinegar and salt of vinegar. Both ingredients are used as flavoring agents and as pH control agents. The USDA said the change in regulations would become effective in 60 days unless it received comments from the public opposing the action. ((Washington commodities desk 202 898 8467))
MCAT	U.S. stocks slid in early trading on Friday  as bonds tumbled following the release of the July National Association  of Purchasing Managers Index data, which showed a rise in the prices  paid component. The Dow industrials was down about 98 points, or over one percent,  to 8123, shortly after the New York Stock Exchange set curbs on index-arbitrage  trading. Nasdaq, which opened firmer, was down 12 points at 1582.   The long bond tumbled 1-13/32 to a 6.40 percent yield. The New York Stock Exchange also said its sidecar curbs went into  effect at 1011 EDT/1411 GMT. The NAPM report read 58.6 in July compared with 55.7 in June.  It  was forecast to read 56.1 for July. The closely-watched prices paid component of the index rose to 53.6  for the month, versus 48.1 in June.   "The index never moves in three percent increments," Robert Froelich,  chief investment strategist at Kemper Funds, said. "For it to go to  58.6 from 55.7 is big." The strong NAPM reading, coupled with an above-forecast July employment  report, ultimately spooked financial markets and revived lurking fears  about inflation and higher rates. The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls grew by 316,000  in July compared with a forecast rise of 193,000. The unemployment  rate dipped to 4.8 percent. "We dodged one bullet but you can't dodge two bullets," Froelich said. ((Wall Street desk 212-859-1730))

GCAT	Here are the major parties and key figures in Japan's general elections on October 20. Strengths by party in the outgoing 511-member Lower House are as of October 10. LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (LDP) - Seats in outgoing Lower House: 211. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's conservative LDP, in unbroken power since 1955 except for a year in opposition, is in a commanding position to continue its rule, whether alone or in a renewed coalition. Hashimoto remains as popular as ever, garnering about 52.3 percent support as prime minister in a Kyodo news agency poll conducted late September. The party itself has some 30 percent support in recent polls. The LDP announced a platform saying it would raise a controversial sales tax from three to five percent next year, but said it would pair the hike with moves to streamline a bloated bureaucracy. Other key players include the forceful Seiroku Kajiyama, who has favoured a grand alliance with the main opposition Shinshinto, as well as Koichi Kato, who has been keen on keeping the current alliance with the so-called "liberal" force of the Socialists, Sakigake and the new Democratic party. SHINSHINTO (NEW FRONTIER PARTY): Strength in outgoing house: 160. Since its foundation in a merger of nine non-Communist opposition parties in December 1994, Shinshinto has become the country's main opposition group. But after winning the most votes in Upper House elections last year, the party has steadily lost steam under leader Ichiro Ozawa and faces serious splits between conservatives and reformists. Ozawa, an LDP defector, has tried to prop up the party's sagging fortunes and boost chances of overtaking the LDP by announcing a drastic set of campaign promises, including scrapping the sales tax hike, an 18 trillion yen ($162 billion) income tax cut, a 25 percent reduction in bureaucrats and radical decentralisation. DEMOCRATIC PARTY of JAPAN (DJP): Strength in outgoing house: 52. This new liberal party was formed just last month mostly from members of the two small parties in the ruling coalition -- the Social Democrats and Sakigake. It is led by Yukio Hatoyama, the scion of a family which bred three generations of well-known politicians, and Naoto Kan, a popular anti-bureaucrat Health Minister who spearheaded a probe into a 10-year old AIDS scandal. If the LDP becomes the largest party after voting day but fails to win a majority of seats, the Democrats could hold the balance of power. SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (SDP): Strength in outgoing house: 30. In 1994 under ex-premier Tomiichi Murayama formed an alliance with their long-time LDP foes and threw out their leftist tenets of opposition to the 1960 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and Japan's post-war military. Since then, however, the party has been split by diehard leftists and a moderate rightwing, the latter finally joining Hatoyama's Democratic Party last month. Murayama then offered party leadership to Takako Doi, Japan's best-known female politician and outgoing Lower House Speaker. The party faces major losses or even extinction in the election. JAPAN COMMUNIST PARTY (JCP): Strength in outgoing house: 15. The Communists, Japan's oldest political party, may benefit from the split of the Socialist party by garnering the pacifist vote and could likely double their strength, but have steadfastly refused to join in any coalition. SAKIGAKE: Strength in outgoing house: 9. The party which suffered most at the hands of Hatoyama's Democrats, Sakigake is under threat to become one of a handful of minor parties. The unpopular ex-Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura resigned as party head after he failed to win agreement to merge his party with Hatoyama's new group and is now led by little-known former Health Minister Shoichi Ide.

GCAT	Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa arrived on Saturday in Lima on only the second visit to his homeland since losing a 1990 election battle with President Alberto Fujimori. A small group of protestors joined friends and relatives at Lima's international airport to greet Vargas Llosa, who lives in Spain. The author left Peru in disgust after Fujimori beat him to the presidency and has frequently criticised his rival as a "dictator." He was returning to Peru as part of a Latin American tour to launch his new book "Don Rigoberto's Notebooks" and receive an honorary doctorate from Lima University. Vargas Llosa's only previous visit to Peru since 1990 was to attend the funeral of his mother.

CCAT	Shares in Japan's construction industry extended their losses on Friday morning, as concerns over bad loans held by construction firms lingered in the market, brokers said. By 0135 GMT, shares which hit new lows for the year included Taisei Corp, Shimizu Corp, Sato Kogyo Co Ltd, Tobishima Corp, Fujita Corp and Kajima Corp. "There are worries over construction firms' bad loans, and we can't forecast good earnings. This is inviting sales," said a broker at a second-tier securities house.
MCAT	The dollar recovered early losses against the mark and yen by late Europe, with traders saying the dollar's underlying tone remained firm. The dollar fell to its session lows in the afternoon as U.S. stock and bond markets opened weaker but recovered some lost ground in late trade. A smaller-than-expected drop in U.S. November factory goods orders had little impact. "We've seen some important lows at 1.5540 marks and 115 yen today and bounced off them. I think the bulk of the selling is out of the way now," said Banque Paribas technical analyst Andrew Chevariat.   At 1605 GMT, the dollar was at 1.5624/27 marks and 115.25/30 yen, down from 1.5662/72 and 115.81/86 late on Monday. U.S. November factory orders fell 0.4 percent, versus forecasts for a 0.6-percent drop. But the data did not spur any dollar moves. Traders said there was a general reluctance to take up positions before U.S. producer price data due on Thursday and the December payrolls data on Friday. "Apart from the dollar/yen, it's mostly been an orders-driven market. It reflects the fact that the dollar market is waiting for Friday's data," said one dealer at a U.S. bank.   Dollar/yen was mostly stable during the European session, cooling off after its recent drop sparked by Japanese officials' comments expressing worries about the yen's volatility. Overnight, Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said an excessively weak or strong yen was unfavourable for Japan's economy. Trade Minister Shinji Sato said an excessively weak yen was troublesome for the economy. Analysts expected the dollar to recover its strength against the yen, saying weakness in the Tokyo stock market supported the dollar against the yen on Tuesday. Tokyo's Nikkei stock average ended down 2.83 percent on Tuesday.   "Stock market nerves feed through into the currency, which in turn increases the attractiveness of overseas assets, which weakens the domestic market and further pressures the currency," said Nick Parsons, currency strategist at Banque Paribas. Against the mark, conditions were choppy but the dollar stayed in a fairly narrow range during the day. November German industry orders were slightly better than expected, rising 3.6 percent year/year against forecasts of 3.2 percent. "As the figures came out better than expected, it suggests rates could be on hold," the U.S. bank trader said. The Bundesbank will hold its next regular policy meeting Thursday.   Buba president Hans Tietmeyer was quoted as saying in a newspaper that he sees no need for a change in rates for the time being. German research institute DIW said it saw German GDP growing 2.0 percent in 1997 against an earlier forecast of 2.5. Conditions were choppy for the Swiss franc with dollar/Swiss pushing down to a session low of 1.3458 francs in afternoon trade before recovering to 1.3536/46 at 1650 GMT. Dealers attributed the fall to technical factors with stops triggered as the mark breached key support levels. -- Chizu Nomiyama, London Newsroom +44-171-542-6721
GCAT	At least five people were killed in a bomb blast and by gunfire in Lahore city on Thursday, police said. They said three people were killed by the bomb at the main railway station and three by shooting at a mosque in central Lahore, capital of the central province of Punjab.   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, which follow a series of recent violent incidents in the home province of new Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who took office 10 days ago after his Pakistan Muslim League party's landslide victory in February 3 elections. On Monday, unknown gunmen killed a senior government official in Lahore, and on Wednesday a Shi'ite Moslem activist in the southern Punjab town of Jahanian was shot dead. Gunmen attacked an Iranian cultural centre in the main southern Punjab town of Multan on February 20, killing eight people, including the centre's Iranian director.
CCAT	The number of rail travellers in China soared in June, rising 25 percent compared with the year-ago month, the Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday. China's railways carried a total of 2.22 million passengers last month, it said, quoting the Ministry of Railways. "This is a considerable increase after years of sluggish rail transport service," Xinhua said, adding that in recent years more people had turned to road or air transport for faster or more comfortable service. The railways, once the top transport choice of tens of millions of Chinese, have struggled to compete with long-distance buses and airlines in recent years. Last year, rail passenger traffic dropped 12.3 percent from the previous year while air travel boomed.
MCAT	Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Monday. LONDON - The stock market climbed to record highs, buoyed by takeover speculation and a turnaround on Wall Street.

HONG KONG - The Hong Kong market was closed for a holiday. On Friday the Hang Seng index ended at a record high of 12,510.05, up 73.25 points. SYDNEY - The Australian share market ended firm, just a few points away from its record closing high after resource stocks found support on the back of a firmer copper price and another record close for the Dow on Friday. The key share market barometer, the All Ordinaries index, closed 8.2 points higher at 2,363.2, three points off its all time record high closing level of 2,366.2, set last week. JOHANNESBURG - South African shares closed a quiet day near opening levels after earlier dipping lower.

ECAT	Venezuelan non-traditional exports, which exclude oil and iron, rose 10.1 percent or $90 million to $1.01 billion in the first quarter of 1997 compared with the same period in 1996, according to the Trade and Industry Ministry (MIC). Exports in March totaled $340 million -- under the Ministry's $500 million monthly target but up $16 million or five percent from March last year, the MIC said in a press release. The month's rise took the quarter's total to over $1 billion, the MIC added. "Common metals" was the strongest export sector in March with 40 percent of the total. "Chemical products" came next with 18 percent, then foods and tobacco at eight percent. Colombia was the chief market for Venezuela's non-traditional exports with 28.1 percent. Venezuela's next largest export market was the U.S. with a 17.5 percent share, followed by the Netherlands with 5.1 percent and Japan with 2.1 percent. ((-- Caracas newsroom, 582 505 2600))
GCAT	Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori arrived in Toronto on Friday for crisis talks with Japan's premier Ryutaro Hashimoto to map out a strategy to peacefully end the 45-day-old Lima hostage crisis. Fujimori landed in a snowstorm at Toronto's international airport amid signs of a widening rift between Lima and Tokyo on negotiations with the Marxist rebels holding 72 hostages in the Japanese ambassador's residence in the Peruvian capital. Tokyo and Lima are divided over whether to give ground on the rebels' main demand that Peru free 400 of their jailed comrades, a Japanese goverment source said in Tokyo on Friday. Negotiations with the roughly 15 Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels holding the ambassadorial compound have been deadlocked for weeks over Fujimori's refusal to discuss the demand. The Japanese source said Hashimoto planned to urge Fujimori to soften his position and allow the rebels' key demand onto the talks' agenda. However, Hashimoto made plain "there must be no caving in to terrorism" at the summit. Deepening Japan's concern have been increasingly aggressive police moves this week outside the ambassador's residence, where two dozen Japanese businessman and diplomats are among the captives. Since last Friday, police have stepped up the war of nerves, saying they wanted to wear down the rebels' resistance. They sent convoys rumbling past the residence at least five times, blasted martial music at odd hours and buzzed the residence with helicopters and planes. The two leaders agreed to meet just two days ago after Hashimoto urged Fujimori to exercise caution to avoid "accidents or incidents." Fujimori and Hashimoto, who have met twice in the past four months, chose Canada because they wanted to meet on neutral ground at a convenient mid-point. Fujimori, who speaks Japanese, was accompanied by two cabinet ministers, five congressmen and his son Kenjy on the 12-hour flight which included a refueling stop in Miami. At the airport, Fujimori was met by Canadian Ambassador Anthony Vincent, one of the more than 500 hostages seized in the Dec. 17 MRTA raid during a garden reception in honour of the Japanese emperor. Vincent later became one of the key mediators between the rebels and the government. Canada's mediating role has been accepted by rebel leader Nestor Cerpa who heads the guerrillas who laid siege to the residence and have strewn mines and booby traps on the grounds. As they go into the talks, the Peruvian and Japanese leaders share similarities: they are men in their late 50s whose tough images have boosted their political careers. But they are under sharply divergent political pressures. The Lima crisis has boosted Fujimori's ratings in opinion polls, but eroded Hashimoto's popularity, already weakened by Japan's economic troubles. On Thursday, the Peruvian leader said he was prepared for the hostage crisis to drag on for months, while Hashimoto noted that the crisis was now at "delicate stage." The summit, which could be preceded by an informal meeting, was aimed at achieving "a very close coordination" according to Fujimori. "If we were in an emergency situation we would need to be in close contact," he said. However, a Pervian government source said Fujimori would not use the meeting to seek approval for a military assault on the compound. The official timetable puts the summit's length at two hours on Saturday morning. After a news conference, they will attend a lunch hosted by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.

MCAT	U.S. cash crudes sustained the day's heavy losses late Wednesday, relfecting bearish news and technical factors, while grades were steady, traders said. Spot January West Texas Intermediate was pegged at $23.35-45 a barrel, down 85 cents from late Tuesday. The onset of Iraqi crude exports, combined with bearish weekly inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute (API), fueled to downturn. Technical factors were also at play, traders said.

ECAT	The International Monetary Fund (IMF) extended its mission in Bulgaria on Thursday hoping to help reduce a large draft 1997 budget deficit a month before introducing of a restrictive monetary regime, officials said. "There are a number of obstascles, which are falling in two groups. The overall problem is that the estimated deficit is larger than we would like and we need to find the way to narrow it," IMF team leader Anne McGuirk told reporters. Preparations on this year's budget were expected to be completed by Friday under IMF preliminary plans. A $657 million reform and funding deal with the IMF envisages reducing budget deficit in 1997 to 3.8 percent from 10.9 percent last year by eliminating the need for central bank credit to the government and rationalising expenditures. This year's  budget is assumed at a lev/dollar exchange rate of 1,600 or 1,000 levs to the German mark. The IMF mission arrived in Sofia in mid-May to help prepare introduction of a currency board in July. This is a self-regulating mechanism where the lev is pegged to an anchor currency at a fixed rate and the amount of levs in circulation must be fully covered by the foreign exchange reserves. "We are discussing the income policy. The most recent data we have received indicated that some (state) enterprises have been raising their wages more rapidly than we think is justified," said McGuirk. After adjustments to inflation and depreciation of the local currency, average state wages have risen from $30 per month to between $100 and $400 monthly in the past several months. Bulgaria's labour and social wellfare ministry aims for $200 accross the board monthly wage in public enterprises, fearing recurrence of street protests, which in January toppled the Socialist government for failure to cope with a grave economic crisis. Most of the payraises are concentrated in loss-making sectors like power-engineering, the national airline and few state banks. "It is not a general problem, it seems to be large in a few sectors and we need to get to the bottom of that problem," said McGuirk. The IMF however, recommends a "prudent" budget deficit, which would help sustain the currency board system, which aims to restore confidence in the volatile lev and troubled local banks, over a longer period. The system bans central bank lending to the government and commercial banks. This year's budget bill is expected to be completed shortly and introduced to parliament for approval in the next few days, said deputy Finance Minister Svetoslav Gavriiski. Gavriiski was nominated by prime minister Ivan Kostov to head the central bank under the currency board system. The central bank's new board has yet to be approved by parliament next week. -- Elisaveta Konstantinova, Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-981-4145
ECAT	Following is the text of a Indian government statement on an income tax ordinance issued by President Shankar Dayal Sharma. "The President yesterday (31.12.96) promulgated the Income-tax (Second Amendment) Ordinance, 1996 by which certain amendments have been made to the Income-Tax Act, 1961. By the Ordinance, the following changes have been made: 1) with effect from 1.4.97, section 80G has been amended to extend the benefit of 100 percent deduction to donors from their taxable income to donations made to the National Illness Assistance Fund.

Failure to file the return will also render the person liable for prosecution; iv) A penalty of 100 percent to 300 percent of the tax leviable may be imposed in respect of the undisclosed income determined on assessment. However, such penalty will not be leviable on the returned income if such person has furnished the return in time, the tax payable on the basis of such income has been paid or the assessee offers the money seized for the adjustment against the tax payable, evidence of the tax paid is furnished along with the return and an appeal is not filed against the assessment of that part of the income which is disclosed in the return; v) The order of assessment will not be required to be approved by the Commissioner, but would be approved by the Deputy Commissioner of Income-tax; vi) The appeal against the order of search assessment will lie to the Commissioner (Appeals) and not to the ITAT as provided earlier; vii) The provisions relating to Chapter XIV-B will apply in respect of cases where the search is initiated on or after the 1st January, 1996." -- New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024
ECAT	Bank of Thailand governor Rerngchai Marakanond said on Saturday the current account deficit this year will be at around 8.2-8.3 percent of the gross domestic product. "Sluggish exports make the current account deficit and trade deficit remain worrysome. The current accound deficit is expected to be around 8.2-8.3 percent of GDP," Rerngchai told a seminar. The current account deficit was at 8.1 percent of GDP in 1995. The Bank of Thailand said late last month exports in the first nine months of 1996 rose only 0.9 percent, compared to more than 20 percent in the same period last year. Rerngchai said he also worries about rising interest payments on foreign debts which contributed to the widening current account deficit in September. The current account deficit in September widened to 30.5 billion baht ($1.22 billion) from 29.3 billion in August. Thailand's current foreign debt amounts to about $87 billlion, accounting for 50 percent of GDP, the governor said. "However external debt remains under the central bank's control. And short-term foreign borrowings showed a declining trend," Rerngchai said. Moody's Investors Service in September downdraded Thailand's short-term sovereign ceiling ratings due to the country's high level of short-term external debt. Rerngchai said foreign inflows over the past four months slowed to $700 million per month compared with $1.7 billion in the first first six months. "Foreign inflows into Thailand will continue to slow further for the rest of this year," he said. --Bangkok newsroom (662) 652-0642
CCAT	Quigley Corp, a maker of cold lozenges, said Tuesday that because of an increase in sales, it is no longer planning to go ahead with a private placement of its common stock. For this reason, it said it has ended its investment banking relationship with Sands Brothers & Co. It said it will continue to tap the services of Smith Barney as its financial adviser for mergers, acquisitions and strategic relationships. The company currently has cash on hand in excess of $10 million and anticipates a multi-million dollar line of credit from a major U.S. commercial bank, said company president Guy Quigley. Those resources, he said, "will enable us to internally finance our steady summer inventory buildup, in expectation of a bumper 1997-1998 cold season."
GCAT	(Corrects and replaces earlier story. The Hong Kong government has retracted its statement that the death toll had risen to 45. The number stays at 39.) The confirmed death toll in a Hong Kong tower block blaze remains at 39, the government said late on Thursday. It amended an earlier statement from a government spokeswoman who had told Reuters by telephone that the toll had risen to 45. Rescue workers were still searching for victims in the devastated building, which stands on the busy Nathan Road in densely populated Kowloon. The inferno began on Wednesday evening and raged through the night, gutting seven of the building's 16 floors. Some 300 firemen and 50 fire engines battled the blaze, which took almost 24 hours to quell. The immediate cause was not known. Hong Kong's worst fire on record was in 1918 when 600 people were killed and 400 injured in a blaze at the Happy Valley Race course on Hong Kong Island.
GCAT	Rescue teams on Saturday completed operations in freezing winter temperatures to save victims of an earthquake that left 500 dead and 2,000 injured in northwestern Iran, a senior official said. Deputy Interior Minister Rasoul Zargar told Iranian television the 3,000 relief workers had completed their rescue efforts this afternoon and within 12 hours would set up temporary shelters for the 35,000 people left homeless in the mountainous region. The earthquake, measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, hit the city of Ardabil and the town of Meshkinshahr at 4.27 p.m. (1257 GMT) on Friday, causing heavy damage to some 83 neighbouring villages, Zargar said. Zargar, who heads the relief operation, said 719 of the injured had been hospitalised. Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani called on authorities to bring speedy relief to the quake-stricken areas and urged people to send aid for the victims. Relief workers have set up 2,500 tents to shelter thousands of families made homeless and distributed blankets, food, heaters and lanterns, the Iranian news agency IRNA said earlier. State-run Tehran radio said local authorities announced three days of mourning in the province of Ardabil. Ardabil is an agricultural province inhabited mainly by Iran's Azeri minority. It is one of Iran's coldest regions, with freezing temperatures during the winter. Tehran Radio earlier said snow in mountainous areas was hampering rescue operations. "My family and I could not sleep last night because of the aftershocks," one resident told Reuters by telephone. "And we could not go outside to sleep because it was too cold with temperatures just below freezing." Early on Saturday, a tremor measuring about four on the Richter scale jolted an area near Bojnourd in northeastern Iran but caused no casualties or damages, IRNA said. In early February, two earthquakes measuring 6.1 and 5.4 on the Richter scale killed at least 79 people and injured 260 in and around Bojnourd. The tremor hit the Ardabil area some 16 hours after a strong earthquake killed nearly 50 people in and around the town of Quetta in Pakistan's Baluchistan province across Iran's southeastern border. A Pakistani state seismic centre in the northwestern town of Peshawar measured that earthquake at 6.2 on the Richter scale. IRNA earlier said a quake also measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale hit the western Iranian city of Sanandaj at about the same time as the tremor hit Ardabil, some 350 km (220 miles) away. It did not report any casualties. Iran's northern province of Gilan on the Caspian Sea was also shaken by a tremor measuring about four on the Richter scale, but there was no damage, IRNA added. Force four and five tremors are powerful enough to cause heavy damage in populated areas. Earthquakes hit Iran regularly. The worst recorded one, measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale, killed 35,000 people in Gilan and neighbouring Zanjan province in 1990.
MCAT	Philippine shares sank to a 20-month closing low on Thursday and analysts said the market is likely to wallow in red ink amid the volatility in the region's currencies. A slump in the Indonesian rupiah pulled down other Southeast Asian currencies including the peso which fell to a low of 29.620 to the dollar in early trade. "The currency volatility plus the fact that most of the first-half corporate earnings are out make the market starved for stock ideas," said Jun Trinidad, research head at DBS Securities. The composite index fell 33.59 points, or 1.33 percent, to 2,493.49 points, the lowest close since December 1995 despite positive news on interest rates. The central bank on Thursday dropped its overnight borrowing rate by four percentage points to 14 percent. At the same time, it raised banks' liquidity reserves to five percent from four percent to reduce liquidity and curtail speculation that might arise from lower interest rates. The declining peso and the higher reserves on banks weighed down the market, traders said. "We are nearing the support and tomorrow it will have to be tested," said Henry Ong, analyst at Sapphire Securities. Traders have pegged initial support at 2,460 and the next level at 2,450 points. Some said a major support lies at 2,400. Analysts said the fall of the peso, which had lost 12 percent of its value since a de facto devaluation on July 11, will eventually lead to higher prices because Philippine industries depend on imported raw materials. "Fundamentals will further deteriorate with higher inflation levels in the second half. The stock market is down on the mat but still conscious. So we can expect it to be battered some more," said Noel Reyes, vice-president at Anscor-Hagedorn Securities. Traders said the possibility of more negative news may even drag the market lower with first-half gross national product expected to be released by the end of the month. "We do not expect first-half gross national product figures to be spectacular and it will just be in line with expectations. Unles the currency problem is settled, we see a bearish market," said Jidgette Valenzuela, research manager at Lippo Securities.
CCAT	Mirror Group Plc said on Monday it was pulling out of the Newspaper Publishers Association (NPA) because it found the organisation "cut-throat" and unproductive. "We do not wish to be a member of a club where other members unproductively spend their time stabbing each other in the back," said chief executive David Montgomery in a statement. A spokesman for Mirror Group declined to give any further details of the company's decision to leave the organisation, which was formed to represent the interests of Britain's national newspaper publishers. "People were just looking after their own interests," said the Mirror Group spokesman, describing the atmosphere of the NPA's regular meetings as cut-throat. Industry analysts were surprised by the move and could shed no further light on the Mirror Group's decision. "I haven't a clue why they've done that," said Jason Crisp of Societe Generale. Mirror Group made clear that its decision to leave the NPA was no reflection on its chairman or any other staff. Its departure will be a blow to the organisation, which is financed by contributions from its members. "Its quite a sizeable blow," said Jean Morgan of the U.K. Press Gazette. The Mirror Group owns the Daily Mirror, Britain's second-best selling tabloid, the Sunday Mirror and The People and has a major stake in the Independent and the Independent on Sunday. The NPA said only that it regretted Mirror Group's decision, but would continue to serve its other members.

ECAT	Brazil buried the hatchet Wednesday with its Mercosur partners over disputed new import financing rules, making the regulations a touch more flexible for goods from the trade bloc. Finance Minister Pedro Malan said he had thrashed out an agreement with visiting Argentine Economy Minister Roque Fernandez that respected both the spirit of Mercosur and its accords and Brazil's new rules on short-term import financing.   "There is no problem between Brazil and Argentina or between Brazil and Mercosur. And I say this with the same tranquillity with which we observe the appearance of disputes like this," Malan told reporters. Argentina led a chorus of Mercosur complaints after Brazil last week imposed new limits on import financing of less than 360 days, effectively forcing importers to pay in cash. In a deal struck Wednesday, which will last for 120 days while more long-term solutions are found, Brazil agreed to two changes to the rules for Mercosur members Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.   -- Firstly, it will change the definition of what constitutes "paying cash", thus increasing the products exempted from the limits on short-term financing. Previously, "cash" meant when payment came in the month after foreign exchange contracts were taken out, or a maximum of 59 days. Under the new agreement, paying in cash will give importers a maximum of 89 days to pay for their goods. -- Secondly, Brazil will raise to $40,000 the value of each import contract exempted from the rules. For non-Mercosur products, import contracts worth less than $10,000 are exempt.   These exemptions only apply if the imports are backed by guarantees from Mercosur central banks known as Reciprocal Trade Credits, or CCRs. Malan said the deal did not apply immediately to Chile and Bolivia, which have signed associate free trade agreements with Mercosur, and that Brazil would hold separate talks with them.   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso greeted the news of a deal with satisfaction, stating he had "never doubted that as in similar circumstances in the past, the dispute would be resolved through dialogue," spokesman Sergio Amaral told reporters. The Brazilian finance minister and his economic team spent two days explaining to Argentine officials that the new rules were not "protectionist," but intended to eliminate interest rate arbitrage opportunities importers had been enjoying between Brazil's sky-high rates and much lower ones overseas.
ECAT	El Salvador's consumer price index for June rose 0.39 percent, compared with 0.23 percent in May, the Economic Ministry said on Thursday. Inflation rose an accumulated 2.59 percent for the year, less than the 5.03 percent registered in the same period in 1996, it said. "The slight rise in the Consumer Price Index is in accordance to the seasonal agricultural production," statistics director Francisco Aleman said in a report.

ECAT	Britain's trade deficit with the rest of the world is expected to widen to 900 million pounds in March from 758 million in February as robust consumer demand starts to suck in more imports, analysts said on Wednesday. "As domestic demand growth gathers pace, import volumes should pick up further," said HSBC economist Dharshini David who sees a March deficit of 900 million pound, in line with the consensus forecast. The figures are scheduled for release at 0830 GMT on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). At the same time, the ONS will also release details of the April non-EU deficit and analysts foresee a 600 million pound deficit, just below 606 million in March. "We expect a modest improvement in the non-EU deficit in April," said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell economist Ciaran Barr. "However, this is entirely due to an improvement in the erratics balance, with the underlying picture expected to deteriorate due to sterling's strength," he said. Barr forecast a non-EU deficit of 575 million pound for April. Analysts said that sterling's 17 percent rise since last August had yet to feed through fully to the trade data, although Barr warned that in terms of global visible trade, underlying import growth was double that of exports. But the UK is still likely to have posted its smallest quarterly deficit in overall trade since the first quarter of 1995, according to Salomon Brothers economist Michael Saunders. He expects the figures to confirm that the global trade deficit was 2.0 billion pound in the first three months of this year, down from 2.6 billion in the final quarter of 1996. He was also optimistic over the outlook for trade in the second quarter, but was less hopeful about the outlook longer term. "The trade gap is likely to trend lower in the second quarter, but start to widen again later this year -- probably in the fourth quarter -- as the adverse effects of sterling's rise on export volumes start to feed through," he said. The Confederation of British Industry's latest industrial trends survey confirmed the gloomy outlook for exports, with the May report showing export demand at its lowest level since 1993. "Our survey shows that the strength of sterling is continuing to take its toll on manufacturers' ability to win export orders," Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director of economic analysis said in the report.
ECAT	Venezuela is pondering whether to apply for an extended IMF fund facility to back structural reforms, Finance Minister Luis Raul Matos Azocar said. "Venezuela is applying its own series of structural reforms,and while we are still talking to the IMF,we have not yet defined the terms of any future extended fund facility," Matos told reporters. Although Matos said Venezuela would still seek multilateral support to back reform of the country's troubled social security, pension and judicial systems, "we're not sure if these will require the IMF's extended fund facility." The Caracas-based Andean Development Corp (CAF) could make funds available for reforms such as these, as well as privatization, Matos said. The IMF's extended fund facility is used to back long term economic reforms, specifically structural changes, typically over a three year period. Venezuala recently said it would not need to draw down the remainder of a short-term, quick-disbursing $1.4 million IMF stand-by loan approved in July. --Omar Lugo, Caracas newsroom, 582 505 2600
MCAT	Shanghai soybean futures ended up on Friday on speculative buying with most investors remaining sidelines, traders said. The only traded March 1997 contract ended at 3,234 yuan ($390) per tonne, rising 134 yuan. It opened at an intraday high of 3,235 and hit a low of 3,230 yuan per tonne. Volume rose to 21,600 tonnes from 20,800 tonnes. "Many investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the weekend and some speculative buying pushed the March contract up," one trader said.   "Hot money continued to flow out of the soybean market due to a lack of market-moving news," he added. Traders said they expected soybeans to move around current levels early next week.

CCAT	One of Estonia's leading banks, Tallinna Pank, said that it plans to make a decision this year on when and how to expand to the Lithuanian market and will also take another 30 million German mark syndicated loan. Rait Lukas, chairman of Tallinna Pank's executive board, told Reuters in a recent interview that like all Estonian banks, Tallinna Pank was considering the Lithuanian market. "Of course we do have a date and we are trying to do as quickly as possible to find or decide something this year (on Lithuania)," Lukas said.   He said that like all Estonian banks, Tallinna Pank has met all the leading Lithuanian banks with a view to exploring the possibilities to expand into Lithuania. Lukas said it was almost impossible to open a new branch in Lithuania. He said that Estonian banks were trying to expand outside Estonia as it was too small a market. "The reason is that very soon it will be the last time to go (to Lithuania) as the bank market is stabilising very fast," Lukas added. Hoiupank has been named as another Estonian bank considering a move to Lithuania and largest bank Hansapank has also said it wants to expand into the southernmost Baltic state.

ECAT	Chinese Premier Li Peng told World Trade Organisation chief Renato Ruggiero on Tuesday that Beijing's long-delayed entry to the gobal trade body would benefit China and the world but hit out at unfair trading practices. "China cannot develop without the world and the world cannot develop without China," state television quoted Li as telling the visiting WTO chief. China was determined to proceed with negotiations on its entry application to the world trade body, Li said. However, he said the issue of China's entry to the WTO should not be politicised, state television said. "This is unfair," it quoted Li as saying. "The world needs China and China needs the world," he said. Ruggiero, who arrived in Beijing on Sunday after a tour of China's booming economic hub, Shanghai, has held talks with Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi. He had urged Chinese leaders on Monday to inject a sense of urgency into their decade-long negotiations to win entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its successor organisation, the WTO, a spokesman said. However, Li hit out at inequalities that he said still marred the world trade system. "In world trade there still exist some inequalities and unequal exchanges in values, there also still exist some sanctions and power policies," Li was quoted as saying, in an apparent veiled reference to the United States, which Beijing regularly charges exercises undue international influence. "This is not in conformity with the principle of equality and mutual benefit and is not in keeping with current world trends," Li said. He repeated China's demands that it be allowed to enter the WTO as a developing country, with a period of transition to meet the criteria for entry, adding that demands on China should not be raised too high. Ruggiero on Monday cited the progress achieved in bilateral talks in Geneva last March and urged Beijing to move faster to ensure its admission. "Now we have to build on that momentum with a sense of urgency in order to accelerate these negotiations," Ruggiero's spokesman Keith Rockwell quoted him as saying on Monday. Diplomats from countries involved in China's crucial bilateral talks on WTO entry said they had seen little change in recent weeks in China's position on fundamental issues holding up its application for admission, despite progress in March. However, Ruggiero, who is not involved in China's entry negotiations since these take place in bilateral talks and with members en bloc, focused on a need for China to show progress on market access -- particularly agriculture and services. Beijing's next opportunity to lay a new offer on the table will come in late May, when non-discrimination -- creating a level playing field -- and ensuring an independent body for judicial review will be among the hottest topics. A wide array of barriers remain to be tackled, diplomats say. Issues on which bilateral agreement remained distant ranged from opening of China's agriculture markets, financial services, insurance and distribution systems to clarifying controversial subsidies to state industry, they said.
ECAT	Macau's year-on-year inflation rate stood at 3.9 percent in the first half of 1997, the Statistics and Census Department said on Monday. The inflation rate is measured by the composite consumer price index, which averages the expenditure patterns of the Protuguese-ruled territory's various income groups excluding housing rents. It grew 4.4 percent in the first quarter year-on-year. In June, it rose 3.3 percent year-on-year and 0.4 percent on May. The inflation rate hit 4.8 percent in 1996, and 8.6 percent in 1995. The unemployment rate from April to June was 3.7 percent, versus unemployment of 3.5 percent between March and May, the Statistics and Census Department said. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6590
GCAT	U.S. and Russian peacekeeping soldiers saw men in Bosnian Serb police uniforms setting a booby-trap near a village where Moslem civilians plan to return to pre-war homes, NATO-led Bosnia peacekeepers said on Thursday. A joint American-Russian patrol investigating an overnight explosion saw the men setting an anti-personnel mine activatred by a trip wire on a road leading to the village of Gajevci, said Stabilisation Force (SFOR) spokesman Major Jan Joosten. "The men fled when they saw the SFOR patrol," Joosten told reporters. SFOR was investigating the incident and the mine still had to be removed and disarmed. The incident coincided with rising tensions around the northeastern village which lies near a former front line inside Bosnia's Serb republic. International relief workers said two explosions in less than a week, one of which damaged a bridge near Gajevi, raised suspicions that Serbs might be trying to sabotage plans by Moslem refugees to move back to the village. A group of 36 families, vetted by international agencies as pre-war residents, had planned to start returning to their old homes earlier this week. An advance team of refugees who tried to enter the village to begin defusing mines on Wednesday were turned back by 200 Serb demonstrators, who threatened them and sang nationalist songs. U.S. and Russian soldiers deployed around the angry crowd to prevent possible violence. The Serb demonstrators dispersed after the commanding American officer in the region, Major-General Montgomery Meigs, held talks with Serb officials. Gajevi was calm on Thursday with U.S. and Russian soldiers conducting joint patrols in the area, a Reuters correspondent reported. A representative of the Moslem refugees, Hazim Nakicevic, told reporters 11 people were able to enter the village on Thursday to begin removing mines. The team was escorted by a U.S.- Russian patrol. Nakicevici said the 36 families would probably move back on Friday. U.N. relief agency spokesman Kris Janowski said the refugee move was an important test case for the Dayton peace agreement which guarantees displaced Bosnians the right to return to their homes. A year after the peace treaty was signed, refugees have managed to return only to areas where their national group currently forms a majority.
MCAT	U.S. September Standard and Poor's 500 futures finished down moderately but above the session's low, relieved once Treasury bond futures closed. T-bonds kept pressure on stocks all day, and once September T-bond futures settled for the week, stocks drifted up from their lows. "We were really just following the bonds in here," an S&P 500 futures trader said. "Locals have been really out of the market so any sort of move is exacerbated by the lack of volume," he said.   Other traders noted that volume on Friday's sell-off did not appear to be as brisk as activity on Thursday's rally to seven-week highs. The dim tone was set early by a stronger than expected U.S. July durable goods report that sent September Treasury bond futures through key support and to the lowest price since early August. Durable goods rose 1.6 percent compared with a forecast for a 0.3 percent rise and a revised 0.2 percent decline in June. Excluding defense, orders rose 3.5 percent in July.   Traders said the market appeared rather non-committal heading into next week. September S&P 500 futures retreated from Thursday's seven-week high but managed to close in the middle of the day's range. September posted an inside day on bar charts, a technical signal of indecision. In Nikkei 225 futures, spread activity was seen early but activity overall was thin, traders said.   September S&P 500 futures ended down 3.05 points to 668.80, Nikkei 225 futures ended down 175.0 points to 21,230.0, Russell 2000 futures posted a 0.60-point gain to 332.20, NYSE Composite index fell 1.65 points to 357.90, Value Line lost 2.40 points to 621.40 and MidCap 400 fell 0.95 to 232.95. -Derivatives Desk, (312) 408-8750;E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com
GCAT	Play on the third day of the fifth and final test match between West Indies and India was abandoned on Saturday because of wet patches on the pitch. The umpires called off play shortly after a 2.00 p.m. inspection. India stood on 194-2 after the opening day, with Friday's play also abandoned because of the weather. Captain Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid had made half-centuries to frustrate the West Indies bowlers. Tendulkar is 62 not out and Dravid is unbeaten on 71. West Indies lead the series 1-0.
CCAT	Bulgaria is seeking investors to help rebuild its capital's run-down airport, its director general said on Wednesday. "We are seeking foreign investors to participate in the airport's long-term development and have already started talks with banks from Europe and Japan," Danyo Adanev told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said the first stage of the airport's delayed reconstruction, which included enlargement of a passenger terminal and building a cargo terminal, was expected to cost $170 million. Repair work, which will be carried out without closing the 56-year-old airport, will be undertaken by Bulgaria's Galvbolgarstroy Plc. "We have established a venture with Glavbolgarstroy for the airport's overhaul and it is opened to other firms and banks willing to join it," Adanev said. Czech Post Investment Bank, based in Prague, has shown interest in investing in the airport but will decide its participation after a feasability study, Adanev said. He said a Bulgarian firm and two British consulting firms, Gibb Business Consulting and Hallcrow, had worked out financial and economic studies for modernising the state-owned Sofia airport, 10 km (6.25 miles) from the city centre. -- Liliana Semerdjieva, Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-84561
CCAT	British water companies should be able to reduce their leakage levels down below 10 percent, deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said on Tuesday. Prescott was answering a question in parliament about water leakage by United Utilities Plc's North West Water unit which he said amounted to 34 percent in 1995/6 according to industry regulator Ofwat. Prescott said that during a recent visit to New York, he had discussed the problem with the city's water authorities. "Their leakage rates are less than 10 percent and they are using technology which has been produced in this country. I see no reason why we can't achieve such levels," he said. As one of his first actions on taking office in May, Prescott, who is responsible for environment policy, held a so-called "water summit" which major British firms in the industry attended. Prescott said all these companies had now replied to questions on leakages which the summit had considered and he hoped to make a statement on the issue shortly. -- London Newsroom +44 171 5427767
GCAT	Older women who take estrogen supplements are also doing their skin a favor because the hormone treatments help prevent the formation of wrinkles and dry skin patches, researchers said on Tuesday. "The odds of dry and wrinkled skin were 25 percent and 30 percent lower, respectively, in women who had used estrogen," Laura Dunn of the University of California at San Francisco said in her study of 3,875 postmenopausal women. About half of all elderly people suffer from at least one skin-related condition that can be a precursor to dangerous bedsores and infections, the report said. "Skin wrinkling can negatively affect psychological well-being, sometimes initiating a vicious cycle of diminished self-care leading to deteriorating outcomes," Dunn wrote in the Archives of Dermatology, a journal published by the American Medical Association. Previous research has suggested that estrogen preserves skin collagen content as well as the elastic properties and thickness of the skin. Hormone supplements are commonly used to keep bones from becoming brittle with age and to ease the discomforting symptoms experienced by some menopausal women.
CCAT	China's largest container ship, with a capacity of 5,250 containers, has set sail on its maiden voyage from Shanghai to Vancouver, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday. The ship, the "Luhe", left Shanghai on Wednesday, the agency said. It will shuttle between China and ports on the western seaboard of North America. The 280 meters-long vessel with a deadweight tonnage of 68,950 tons is one of six container ships bought by the China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company from Japan. Xinhua said the other five will be handed over before October, giving China Ocean's fleet a total loading capacity of more than 200,000 containers.
CCAT	Pay TV operator Australis Media Ltd said it had allotted 14.89 million shares as a result of the conversion of convertible notes. The shares were issued in two tranches to two nominee companies, 276,900 shares to Calex Nominees Ltd and 14.6 million to Westpac Custodian Nominees Ltd. No additional funds were received by the company as a result of the issue of the additional securities.   On Tuesday, Australis announced financing details for its future operations, saying a consortium involving Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd (PBL) and Lenfest Communications Inc would provide the company with US$105 million of equity finance. The fundraising commitments are subject to conditions which include the completion of a new U.S. offering and the equity raising in a combined minimum amount of US$250 million and U.S. bond holders' consent. The company said it hoped to complete the new U.S. offering by October 1996.   Australis shares closed 13 cents higher at 25 cents on turnover of 4.6 million shares on Wednesday after being reinstated following a suspension of trading since Monday. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373 1800
MCAT	Wall Street stocks look set to open steady to higher on Monday, with markets keeping an eye on economic data, especially the National Association of Purchasing Managers' (NAPM) survey. Analysts said their forecasts were prompted in part by unchanged bond prices, a stronger dollar and a rising Standard & Poors futures index. "I see a steady to slightly higher opening, and then all eyes will be on the NAPM," said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments.
MCAT	The U.S. hog/corn ratio for the week ended Aug 17 was 12.6 versus 13.3 in the previous week and 18.4 in the corresponding week a year ago, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The steer/corn ratio in the week was 13.5 versus 13.9 in the previous week and 22.7 in the year-ago week. The ratio represents the number of bushels of corn that can be bought at Omaha for 100 lbs of hog or steer.
MCAT	Israeli bond prices closed higher in moderate trading on Thursday, amid reports that a broad economic package deal was in the works and continued optimism about interest rates, traders said. Indices: * Government bonds general: +0.04 pct to 167.23 * CPI (consumer price index) linked government bonds: +0.02 pct to 168.03 * Dollar-linked government bonds: +0.18 pct at 165.28 * Unlinked government bonds (Gilon - issued for four years): +0.13 pct to 166.93 * Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: +0.04 pct at 158.27 Gidi Halpern, an investment manager at Meitav Securities and Investments, dismissed the reports of a package deal, but said it was possible that short-term interest rates would be cut by more than was previously expected. "There are leaks (about an economic package)," he said. "What's more important is that (Bank of Israel Governor Jacob) Frenkel will lower interest rates, perhaps by more than 0.5 percentage point." Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quoted on Thursday as saying a comprehensive economic package, including a new "long-term monetary policy" would be unveiled after parliament approved the 1997 budget in December. Prices for CPI-linked short bonds continued falling for the second day in response to the low September consumer price index released on Tuesday. The central bank is due to announce interest rates for November at the end of October. Its key lending rate stands at an annualised 15.5 percent. Medium- and long-term CPI bonds continued to rise, which Halpern attributed to a technical rebound in response to last summer's collapse of bond prices. "This is in line with the trend of the last month and a half during which prices rose five percent," he said. "Yields are now at low levels." The yield on CPI long bonds are about 4.7 percent, versus 5.2 at their peak in August. Dollar-linked bonds continued rising, although more moderately than on Wednesday, against a further strengthening of the dollar in the local currency market. The dollar ended higher in volatie trading. The representative rate was set at 3.2350, against 3.2030 on Wednesday. Halpern said expectations for a further depreciation of the shekel had grown as prospects for an interest rate cut strengthened. Unlinked bonds were also affected by the inflationary outlook and prices were ahead 0.2 percent. At about 15.6 percent, said Halpern, "yields on the Makam are at their lowest in half a year." Yields on the unlinked Gilon are at about 16.5 percent, their lowest in four months. Note: Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year. The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity. ($1= 3.23 shekels) - David Rosenberg, Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211
CCAT	Cincinnati Milacron Inc said on Monday it has orders worth about $23 million from Hyundai Space and Aircraft and Hyundai Precision and Industries Co, both affiliates of South Korea's Hyundai Group. The company said its 13-machine order will focus on the production of wing spars and stringers for the McDonnell Douglas Corp MD-95 aircraft as part of Hyundai's greenfield wing manufacturing plant which is being constructed in Seosan, South Korea. Actual production is set for early 1999, the company said, and deliveries are scheduled to begin as early as February and extend through March 1998.
CCAT	Genentech Inc said Monday it has decided to change the way it funds international research and development, as well as manufacturing, for some products, thereby adjusting corporate tax rates. Genentech said it expects its tax rate to be 20 percent for the fourth quarter of 1996 and the full year 1996 versus the previously expected 33 percent. Adjusting for the change in the third quarter ended September 30, Genentech saw a $1.8 million net tax benefit. It expects its 1997 tax rate to increase to around 35 percent.   "Genentech is reviewing its operating plan for 1997 and beyond," the company said in a statement.  "In connection with that review, the company has decided not to implement, at this time, the previously announced approach for research and development funding and manufacturing by international subsidiaries of certain of its development products, which are progressing in clinical trials." In the third quarter, Genentech reported net income of $50.9 million, or $0.41 a share, versus $40.2 million, or $0.33 a share, one year ago.  The year-ago figure includes a pre-tax $9.0 million charge. Revenues for the third quarter rose to $251.7 million from $223.9 million one year ago. Sales of Activase, used to treat heart attack patients, fell to $65.4 million in the third quarter from reported sales of $73.2 million one year ago.  Market share, however, remained at about 80 percent. Protropin and Nutropin, Genentech's two growth hormones, saw combined sales rise to $57.6 million from reported sales of $54.2 million one year ago.  Genentech continues to hold two-thirds market share for growth hormone products, it said.
ECAT	Russia will start later this month paying back debts to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), a senior aviation official said on Thursday. Vladimir Pozdnyakov, deputy chief of Russian Federal Aviation Service (FAS), told Reuters that the first payment would be made in December. He said this would cover the debt for 1995. "Next January-February we will pay back debts for 1996," Pozdnyakov said. He did not say how much money Russia would pay to the ICAO, but ITAR-TASS news agency said Russia owes $2 million to the association. Last week FAS head Gennady Zaitsev met ICAO president Assad Kotaite in Canada. -- Moscow newsroom, +7095 941 8520
MCAT	Heavy foreign buying sustained the Nairobi Stock Exchange 20-share index upward trend on Friday, brokers and bourse officials said. The index edged 13.35 points to close at 3536.17. Turnover was posted at 62.796 million shares on 1,213,320 shares compared to 45.221 million shillings on 2,397,639 shares on Thursday. "Slowly but surely they're gaining confidence in our market," a financial analyst said of foreign investors. "They're taking positions on good strong shares knowing very well that most (financial) company year-end results are about to be released," a senior broker said. Another broker said that as a result local investors who found the price too high had resorted to a selling position and were making handsome profits. Foreigners traded 400,000 shares of Uchumi Supermarket at a reserve price of 44 from 40 and 350,000 shares of Firestone East Africa at 33 from 30. They also traded 42,200 shares of Barclays Bank of Kenya at 120 unchanged. Kenya Breweries gained 4.0 to close at 57 after it announced an interim dividend of 2.0 on Thursday. "The way the market is behaving now, I really think what they say about investor behaviour -- Buy on a rumour sell on a fact -- is true," a bourse official. Heavy investment in financials is been driven by speculation about year-end results expected any time now. Dealers reported that the market was in an upbeat mood and players felt that the worst that could happen is a repeat performance of last year -- rising profits. Standard Chartered Bank eased to 56.50 from 57 while National Bank of Kenya was unchanged at 16. Rea Vipingo Plantations closed at 12 from 11.90. --Wambui Chege, Nairobi Newsroom ++254-2 330-261.
ECAT	The State (central) Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Monday the government and state-run companies should lower their bank borrowing to allow more credit at lower lending rates to the private sector. "The first and foremost requirement for increasing the availability of credit to the private sector at lower mark-up (lending) rates was...to substantially scale down unsustainably high level of bank borrowing," an SBP statement said. The statement, issued after an SBP board of directors' meeting in Karachi, said the government's borrowing for budgetary support stood at 74.30 billion rupees ($1.85 billion) during the period from July 1, 1996 to March 29, 1997. The government's borrowing target for the whole of fiscal 1996/97 (July/June) was set at 44 billion rupees compared to 33.3 billion rupees borrowed in 1995/96, it said. The SBP predicted a further "excessive credit creation" in the coming months because it said lending for commodity operations related to wheat harvesting season starting in May. It said several inefficient public sector corporations continued to cover their operational losses through bank borrowing, "thus delaying their day of reckoning" while crowding out the more productive private sector.
MCAT	Kobe rubber futures were mostly weaker in thin after-hours trade on Thursday, traders said. Prices ranged from 0.6 yen per kg lower to 0.1 yen firmer than the day's close. Benchmark March was 0.2 yen lower at 136.7 yen. Volume was thin with only 4,828 lots traded. During the day, most of prices edged lower, weighed down by the yen's firmer tone against the dollar. "There is a view that the number of deliveries at the spot expiry later this month will not be very large, which will provide support to the market. But that factor would not be enough to encourage active buying," one trader said.

MCAT	North American bunker prices were steady to higher on Tuesday, with the East Coast finding support on concerns of low U.S. stocks for heating oil, traders said. "I think the East Coast markets are on an uptrend because of heating oil stocks," said one New York Harbor player. Industry inventory data released today registered a draw in heat stocks, although this is the season for building ahead of winter demand. In New York Harbor, 380 CST traded for $125 and $130 in a fluctuating market due to supply tightness, traders said.   After a long lull, West Coast markets picked up Tuesday as shippers realized prices driven up during last month's Iraq crisis were not going to come down. Los Angeles 380 CST traded $117/118 and 180 CST moved at $120/121. "Shippers here have been holding off, hoping the market would come down.

CCAT	IBCA, the European credit rating agency, said it affirmed the ratings for Sears Plc, at a long-term rating of BBB plus and short-term rating of A2.   "Sears has issued a trading statement detailing a mixed performance so far in the second hald of fiscal year 1997, revealing disappointing like-for-like sales in the important Christmas period and warning of a significant fall in 1997 pre-tax profits below the 100 million stg (pre-exceptions) achieved in fiscal 1996," IBCA said in a statment. Sear has also confirmed the sale of its Freemans mail order operation to Littlewoods for 395 million stg. The sale will result in a 130 million stg profit on disposal before goodwill and an exception loss of 220 million stg after writing off goodwill acquired on the original purchase, IBCA said. "Although the sale of Freemans will allow more management time to be spent on trying to improve the results of the remaining businesses, sales proceeds are to be distributed to shareholders rather than invested in other group operations," IBCA said. "Further remedial action is paramount, and may involve further disposals, but current management may be running out of time," IBCA said. "No rating action is being taken at this stage but progress will be monitored closely." -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 6176

GCAT	Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), a breakaway group of Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's Janata Dal (JD) party, won a confidence vote in the eastern state of Bihar, state assembly officials said.   Officials said Yadav's victory was announced by Deo Narayan Yadav, Speaker of the Bihar Assembly. There was commotion in the house resulting from opposition protests as Parliamentary Affairs Minister Raghunath Jha moved the vote of confidence, and Yadav then asked those in favour of the motion to go to the lobby outside and vote, witnesses said. The speaker declared Laloo Yadav's group as having won the confidence vote with 168 members casting their vote in his favour and none against in the 324-member state assembly, they said. The Congress party announced on Monday its decision to abstain during the vote. Yadav's main opposition was from members of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). "It (the vote) is a victory of democracy and a defeat of the followers of fascism," Yadav said. Yadav had formed the RJD on July 5, protesting against alleged malpractices in the Janata Dal's presidential elections on July 3. But he said he had nothing against Gujral, and continued to support his federal coalition government. --New Delhi newsroom, +91-11-301 2024
MCAT	IPE Brent crude oil futures continued to  trade lower on Friday afternoon, as the market looked for direction  from the U.S. and waited for any news of resumed Iraqi oil exports. By 1440 GMT front month crude was 24 cents lower at $18.70 a barrel,  with August gas oil 50 cents higher on the day at $169.75 a tonne. Traders were looking to see what buying opportunities New York traders  would find in the new front month U.S. product contracts. "It's a question of wait and see at the moment," said one.   The prospect of resumed Iraqi exports also weighed on the New York  market, where NYMEX crude was trading 17 cents lower at $19.97 a barrel. The market was keeping a close eye out for any further news from the  U.N. concerning its awaited approval for Iraq's aid distribution plan,  brokers said. The United Nations said late on Thursday it expected Iraq's aid distribution  plan to get the go-ahead early next week. But some brokers believe the UN news is already factored into the  market, and are not expecting the approval to spur any major moves.    "The UN news was already doing the rounds on Thursday afternoon,"  one broker said. A UN spokesman attributed the delay in the rubber stamping of Iraq's  aid distribution plan to a computer virus affecting one of the diskettes  containing Baghdad's proposals. "It is settled from our point of view. We asked Iraq for certain assurances...and  we received them in writing," the spokesman said. --Simon Gardner, London Newsroom + 44 171 542 7714

GCAT	A member of the committee which led a hardline coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991 won a seat in Russia's upper house of parliament this weekend in one of a series of setbacks to the Kremlin. Itar-Tass news agency said on Monday that communist-backed Vasily Starodubtsev won 60 percent of the vote in an election for governor of the arms manufacturing centre of Tula, some 200 km (125 miles) south of Moscow. Starodubtsev, head of a show-case collective farm in Soviet days, was a member of the eight-men committee of hardliners who tried -- and failed -- to overthrow Gorbachev. He automatically becomes a member of the upper house. Communist Anatoly Belonogov scored a similarly easy victory for the governorship of the Amur region bordering China, while nationalist Dmitry Rogozin won a seat in the lower house of parliament in the southern region of Voronezh. Rogozin is head of the nationalist Congress of Russian Communities which has cooperated closely general Alexander Lebed, an outspoken foe of President Boris Yeltsin. The victories of the Kremlin opponents appear to reflect widespread popular discontent with the government's economic policy, above all with huge backlogs in pensions and salaries. Opposition-backed trade-unions plan a nationwide day of strikes and other protest on Thursday over the wage delays and their leaders say millions will participate in the action.

MCAT	Thai stocks took a heavy beating on Thursday as rumours swirled in the market that the country's long-term debt ratings were about to be downgraded by two major international ratings agencies. Rumours circulated that Thailand faced possible downgrades from Standard and Poor's Corp and Moody's Investors Service. Stock analysts said they expected the fragile market to be unnerved further by more rumours and speculation until a new government with a strong economic team was formed after elections on November 17. Finance Minister Bodi Chunnananda tried to calm the market by rejecting the rumours but waves of foreign and local selling failed to ebb, sending the stock index down 3.04 percent. The SET index tumbled 32.14 points to 1,026.54 at the close, its lowest finish since September 12. Bodi said he had been told by Moody's that it would take four to five months to review Thailand's long term rating. S&P had also assured him that the agency would maintain its current rating on Thai long term debts. "There is still no change in Thai ratings. Moody's has asked for about four to five months to review Thailand's long-term rating," he said. Other brokers said that worries about the quality of a new government to be formed after the elections also cast a pall of gloom over the market. Some blamed talk that the nation's top bank, Bangkok Bank Plc, planned to raise the interest rates on all its fixed deposit accounts as another negative for the market. "The ratings rumour, the Bangkok Bank talk and worries about whether there would be a capable government after elections combined to push down prices," said Susheel Narula, head of research at Seamico Securities. "In this fragile market, I expect more of the same ahead and the market won't improve just yet," he said. Investors also sold on concerns about local economic problems, such as a slowing economy and sagging exports, and on expectations of poor third-quarter corporate earnings, said Samart Rusmeerojwong of James Capel Asia. Money market dealers said offshore baht investors shaken by the rumours in the stock market took cover, rushing into forward U.S. dollar positions. "There was heavy bidding for forward dollars from Singapore in the afternoon on the rumour. This pushed the swap premium up," said a dealer. The one-month dollar/baht swap premium rose to 8.50/9.00 satangs per dollar late on Thursday compared with 7.00/8.00 earlier on the offshore demand for forward dollars.

MCAT	Mexican overnight Cetes rates rose 45 basis points to 18.35 percent after a correction from the closing rate of 17.90 percent on Thursday, dealers said. "Yesterday at the close, there were a few trades below 18 percent, but in reality they were not representative. Today is going to be a quiet day, with rates maybe a little lower," one analyst said. Analysts said the average rate on Thursday was 18.66 percent, which was a more representative rate.   Another dealer said that since the opening of trade today there were a number of buy offers, which could drive the government paper down to about 18.0 percent at the close. He said strength in the peso today could abet the downward slope in rates. Dealers forecast that the meeting of the Open Market Committee of the U.S. Federal Reserve next Tuesday could cause some nervousness in the market.   "There are opinions on whether rates will rise or not. My opinion is that they will rise 25 basis points and that could cause some pressure in our market next week," one dealer said. Overnight rates on bank paper rose 10 basis points to 19.25 percent. Liquidity of 1.178 billion pesos was scheduled to return to the system from prior central bank participation.

CCAT	The World Wide Web might be coming to a pay phone near you thanks to the teaming up of a small Canadian multimedia company and a Hong Kong telecommunications concern. King Products Inc announced on Tuesday it received an initial US$2.2 million order to supply multimedia and Internet-ready pay phones to INFA Telecom Asia Ltd of Hong Kong. Called the PowerPhone, the units will be installed in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in time for the July 1 handover ceremony marking the transfer of the former British colony to China. The PowerPhone will also be installed in railway stations and other popular tourist spots in Hong Kong and throughout China. "The PowerPhone is a major advance from the pay phones of the past that we have all become familiar with," King President Peter Richards told reporters at a news conference. The wall-mounted unit is a combination pay phone and networked computer that allows the display of such things as advertising, telephone directories, as well as hotel and restaurant reservations. Company officials explained that the phone can be used to find a restaurant, make a reservation or call up a map for directions. The phones will also allow users to send and receive e-mail and surf the Internet, although these features will be phased in over time. The phone comes with a handset, a flat panel color touch screen and a slot for smart cards and credit cards. It is powered by an Intel Corp Pentium processor and uses various Internet and Ethernet protocols, as well as an MPEG card to run videos. "We expect to deploy the PowerPhone throughout Hong Kong and subsequently into China over the course of the year," INFA Telecom Chairman Peter Tsang said in a statement. King, best known for its line of electronic kiosks in malls and other public areas, will be manufacture the units in Canada for INFA Telecom, which has operations in some 70 Chinese cities. iMagic Infomedia Technology Ltd of Hong Kong is providing software development for the product. King officials said the PowerPhone will be distributed in North America, but they were unable to say when the product would be released here. ((Reuters Toronto bureau 416-941-8100))
MCAT	Italian debt markets ended buoyantly but below a record peak set by the front month futures contract, with positive sentiment boosted by an EU deal on fiscal discipline and jobs. EU finance ministers agreed a resolution on employment, dousing a row over a stability pact on budget deficit levels and rescuing plans to form the single European currency. The agreement, which by this morning had been expected by the market, served to soothe recent worries over the EMU process. The Btp September future on LIFFE flew to a fresh record high of 132.39 on expectations of the deal.   By late trade however it was standing 43 basis points up on the day at 132.22. "The market is long so it's difficult to find new buyers around these levels," a London based broker said. Once the accord was announced the future settled down to range trade quietly between 131.95 and 132.25. Further resistance was pencilled in at 132.50 and then 132.78. The February 2007 bond was 37 basis points up at 98.64 with the yield 7.05 percent and the spread over Bunds 138 basis points. Brokers said sentiment was positive but the risk now lay with Bunds. Some saw the spread closing in 90 basis points.   "But we need to see if the spread closes in because Bunds fall or because Btps rise," one broker said. The market would now watch what else came out of the EU meeting in Amsterdam, traders said, adding that there might be some profit taking in the meantime. At home, the Treasury's auction of 1.5 trillion lire of 10-year Btps attracted demand for more than twice the amount of paper on offer and yields fell. --Charlotte Cooper, Milan bureau +392 66129507
ECAT	Taiwan's index of leading business indicators, which forecasts peaks and troughs in the business cycle, rose for the seventh consecutive month in March, a cabinet agency said on Monday. The index rose 1.1 percent in March from February to 104.2, the cabinet's Council for Economic Planning and Development said in a statement. The index of coincident indicators all rose in March, gaining 1.6 percent to 103.3 from a month ago, it said.
ECAT	German retail price inflation ticked up in May to post an annual rate of 1.6 percent after prices increased by 0.4 percent from the previous month, the Federal Statistics Office said on Tuesday. The rise in year-on-year inflation followed a three-month streak of falls, but was still below a January high of 1.8 percent. Prices had risen in April by 1.4 percent on a year earlier, but were unchanged month-on-month. The Statistics Office said that its earlier estimates for consumer price growth for economically dominant western Germany had been confirmed. West German prices were up 1.5 percent compared to a year ago, and also rose 0.4 percent from April. In the formerly-communist east, prices were up by an annual 1.8 percent, and also rose by 0.4 percent from April. Significant west German price gains in May came in fresh meat, up 1.3 percent from April, coffee (+3.8 percent) and voluntary health insurance contributions (+3.7 percent). The price of package holidays also jumped, as is typical for the time of year, by 8.1 percent, the Statistics Office said. Some fresh vegetables fell in price during May, with green vegetables down 9.9 percent, tomatoes cheaper by 7.2 percent and cucumbers down by 8.6 percent. Some vegetables, however, jumped in price, including onions (+19.4 percent) and cauliflower (+9.1 percent).
ECAT	Germany's economic recovery is not yet gathering strength, the Federation of German Industry (BDI) said on Thursday. Dynamic exports and the gradually rising capital investment give some grounds for optimism, but the broader economy is still sluggish due to high unemployment and slack private consumption, BDI said in a regular report. Government consumption is being squeezed by austerity constraints, it said. Future developments depend on capital investment, the interest-rate outlook and the resolution of outstanding policy questions such as tax reform, it said. Germany must also not waver on decisions regarding European monetary union, to dispel volatility on the foreign exchange market, which can have a damping effect on investment, he said. -- Terence Gallagher, Bonn newsroom, 49-228-2609750
ECAT	Newly-appointed Polish  Finance Minister Marek Belka said the first quarter of the year will show whether the economy needed to be cooled down by higher interest rates or other policy measures. Belka told Reuters that even though the last quarter of 1996 showed signs of excess demand, the overall growth rate of about six percent was sustainable and the first months of this year would offer more clues on whether the economy was really overheating. "We've had some frenzy at the end of the year but the first quarter will decide whether it is a longer phenomenon and I believe that we should calmly wait also with interest rates," he added in an interview. "This is a period of calming down and we will see then what happens with credit and foreign trade," Belka said. He added that real rates had already gone up, as nominal rates had stayed unchanged since mid-year while year-on-year inflation had slowed down. Inflation fell in 1996 to 18.5 percent from 21.6 percent in 1995. The National Bank of Poland has warned that last year's strong rise in domestic demand and consumer spending in particular, called for monetary tightening and could provoke an interest rate rise. But after last month's decision to raise mandatory reserves on deposits from the end of this month, the bank said it would wait with changes in its lombard and discount rates, now at 25 percent and 22 percent, for the results of its reserve move. Belka, 45,  was appointed on Tuesday finance minister and deputy prime minister, replacing Grzegorz Kolodko who resigned after three years in office. -- Tomasz Janowski +48 22 653 9700

MCAT	Cocoa futures could attempt to rally back towards the psychological 1,000 stg barrier basis September but selling pressure is still likely to be heavy, technical analysts said on Friday.   Traders called the London market to open around six stg higher than Thursday's close after a mixed bag of trade and speculative buying drove New York to end higher across the board. Although London's benchmark September contract only ended one stg up on the day at 987, the contract close was at the upper end of the range after clawing its way back from hitting a fresh four-month low at 965 stg. Technical analysts said Thursday's constructive close suggested the market's outlook was gradually turning more bullish as September aimed to move back into the range above 1,000 stg dating from March. "I suppose there is still the risk that any move is still corrective but I think we should see a test of 1,000 and possibly even get up to 1,010," said Adrian Haylor, a technical analyst at Sucden. "It's looking a bit better short term but the most it can achieve is to return to the range of 1,000 and 1,065," he said. Short-term momentum indicators are still moving in oversold territory although they are edging higher towards the neutral zero level. Fundamentally, traders are still monitoring crop developments in West Africa, with a better picture of the 1997/98 Ivorian crop expected to emerge next month. -- Jeremy Smith, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8064
CCAT	South Africa's Johannesburg Stock Exchange said on Wednesday that it had suspended the listing of Northfields Gold Mine Ltd after being informed that it had been placed under provisional liquidation. "Accordingly the listing of Northfields' securities has been suspended on the JSE with immediate effect," the exchange said in a brief statement. A spokesman for the firm told Reuters that the liquidation order from the Witwatersrand division of the Supreme Court had been placed after several members of senior management stole a number of shares. He added that the order was temporary and money was already available to lift the order, which would probably happen in one to two weeks time. The provisional liquidation order had been placed on December 5, but the Northfields spokesman said the delay in informing the JSE had been caused by confusion as to who should contact the exchange. -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003

GCAT	The trial of two British nurses for murder in Saudi Arabia resumed on Sunday but witnesses said the women were not in court. Lawyers for Deborah Parry and Lucille McLauchlan planned to present critical new evidence in a bid to spare them from the threat of public beheading if found guilty. Lawyers leaving the courthouse refused to comment at the end of the 45-minute session which was also attended by the consuls from the Australian and British embassies. Witnesses said Parry, 38, and McLauchlan, 31, who had arrived at some previous hearings in a police van from their prison -- were not in court. It was not immediately clear when the next session would be held. Lawyers for the two women had said on Saturday they would present critical new proof that could undermine the right of the victim's family to demand the death penalty if they were found guilty of killing Yvonne Gilford, an Australian colleague. The Islamic sharia court had adjourned on July 27 to give defence lawyers two weeks to produce the evidence. Parry and McLauchlan are accused of murdering Gilford, 55, last December at a military medical complex in the eastern Saudi city of Dhahran where they all worked. They say they are innocent and they have withdrawn confessions which they said they were forced to sign. According to Saudi law, the victim's immediate family -- her mother Muriel and brother Frank -- has authority to demand the death penalty if the defendants are found guilty and the court rules the death penalty is appropriate. Execution in Saudi Arabia is usually beheading by the sword in a public square. Frank Gilford has repeatedly said he prefers the maximum sentence. "Following the hearing on 27 July 1997, we have obtained evidence regarding the mental competence of Mrs Muriel Gilford, the mother of the deceased. This evidence will be placed before the Sharia court on Sunday," the Law Firm of Salah al Hejailan, which is defending the women, said in a statement on Saturday. Legal experts in Riyadh said that under Saudi law, a call for the death penalty by a victim's family must be unanimous. They said that if Muriel Gilford was mentally incapacitated Frank Gilford could not make the decision alone. Australian authorities would have to appoint her a guardian other than her son to make the life-or-death decision, they said. Lawyers for the victim's family in Saudi Arabia were not available for comment. The South Australian state Supreme Court on Friday barred Frank Gilford from calling for the death penalty for the two nurses and ordered him not to make further comments on behalf of his family until his mother's mental state had been assessed. Lawyers in Australia representing the nurses said Yvonne Gilford's mother suffered from Alzheimer's disease and was not mentally competent to agree with her son's call for execution. Defence lawyers said they had obtained the evidence on Muriel Gilford's health from the Australian court. They have said that the new documents could eliminate the possibility of a death sentence.
ECAT	Israel's industrial exports rose 9.9 percent in the first seven months of the year to $10.736 billion, the Industry and Trade Ministry said on Tuesday. Exports of polished diamonds rose 8.4 percent in the January to July period to $2.643 billion. Industrial exports without diamonds rose 10.4 percent to $8.093 billion. The minstry said the trend of growth in the high-tech sector strengthened during the period in comparison with the more traditional sectors such as textiles, food and jewellery. The largest increases occurred in exports of telecommunications and inspection equipment, medical diagnostic equipment and chemicals and petroleum products. Exports of electronic components, office equipment, metal products, motors and electrical equipment also rose. Exports in the food, beverage and tobacco sector fell 18 percent, while jewellery exports dropped 9.5 percent and textile exports declined two percent. -- Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211 TCC

GCAT	The Lesotho government announced on Friday it had banned all demonstrations around the palace of King Letsie III. Opposition parties held two marches to the palace this week to demand the sacking of Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle. Deputy Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili told the national assembly the ban was intended to stop demonstrations which were aimed at "dragging His Majesty into the political dust in the interests of party-political leaders who were fighting for power". Mokhehle recently formed the Lesotho Congress for Democracy Party with a faction of his then ruling Basotholand Congress Party (BCP). He took a majority of the 65 members of parliament with him to form a new governing party and about 20 BCP members have refused to recognise the government. Mosisili said the government was also tightening security around the palace, in line with recommendations by a commission of experts from New Scotland Yard. Local observers fear the wrangling between Mokhehle and the rump BCP could turn violent ahead of elections scheduled for next year, drawing in the security forces which have proved incapable of staying out of politics. For decades the pastoral kingdom the size of Belgium has seen repeated fighting and intervention by the military and royalty in daily politics.
MCAT	SOLIDERE shares rose on the Beirut Secondary Market (BSM) amid quiet trade in the week ended on Friday and dealers did not expect prices to start firming up before the end of August. A shares rose to $104.625 on Friday on the privately-operated BSM from a record low of $103.00 last Friday and B shares rose to $106.5 from $105.00. "Nothing exceptional is going on at this point," a dealer said. "I think the trend is still continuing. Prices haven't firmed up yet. I don't expect much to happen before at least end of August, as most people are still on vacation," he added. On the official Beirut Stock Exchange, there was trade in only one of the four listed companies throughout the week. Ciments Libanais closed at $1.1875 on Friday unchanged from last week.

ECAT	The head of Brazil's national Treasury, Murilo Portugal, said Thursday September's 408 million real cash concept Treasury deficit was a good result. Portugal noted that in primary terms, not including interest payments, revenue had increased to 7.395 billion reais in September from 7.12 billion reais in August, while expenditure had declined to 6.684 billion reais from 6.919 billion reais. "September showed good numbers," Portugal told reporters.   He said the 711 million real primary surplus in September compared favourably with a 201 million primary surplus in August and that the Treasury had reduced its securities in the market to 75.074 billion reais from 75.879 billion reais in August. The Treasury's debt with the Central Bank, however, rose to 32.046 billion reais in September from 31.678 billion reais in August.   Portugal noted that the Treasury was gradually increasing the average maturity of its paper to 3.88 months in September from 3.73 months in August. In September 1995, the average maturity of Treasury notes was 4.09 months. In a statement, the Treasury said real average interest rates had risen in September from August due to low inflation, with the Treasury paying an average of 1.74 percent a month, deflated by the IGP-M index, versus 1.67 percent a month. -- Michael Christie, Brasilia newsroom 55-61-2230358

CCAT	Like any marriage, the $20 billion merger of MCI Communications Corp. and British Telecommunications Plc may be smoothed by the experiences of the two-year courtship that preceded it. "I may be an incurable romantic, but I think this is going to be a lot easier than people think," one BT insider said. Concert, the name of the planned merged company, was the original name for a global communications offspring conceived by the two companies in July 1994 to provide a one-stop shop for multinational corporations. While the executives atop the new merged company have a clear vision of where they are going, insiders and industry sources say the acid test will be how the engine rooms of networks, billing, support and customer service are melded. Concert, now called Concert Communication Services, was a wayward child in the early days, and progress was slowed by turf wars and bickering about which standard or system to use. "Some of those turf wars were really destructive," said Daniel Briere, a consultant at TeleChoice Inc., who has worked with Concert Communications and its parents. A computer and software system to support prepaid Concert calling cards in Britain was delayed many months while BT and MCI managers each fought to have their own design used. Similarly, a videophone product developed by BT for MCI failed on both sides of the Atlantic at a cost of millions of dollars. "This huge 'hands across the water' friendship never worked in practice that I saw," Briere said. However, sources inside both companies believe the tough decisions have already been made and that a unified management can more easily fix the remainder precisely because of the experience they already have in working together. "Those debates by and large are behind us," said MCI chief engineering officer Fred Briggs. "A unified management always shortens the decision-making process some." "It may sound weird, but you take out the need for cooperation (in a merger)," TeleChoice's Briere said. "You can choose the best and discard the rest." Concert Communications is already producing evidence of this. The venture has $1.5 billion of revenue under contract and has networks active in 800 cities in 50 countries. It has a head start over rival alliances Global One and Unisource, backed by Sprint Corp. and AT&T Corp., respectively. Some analysts see a danger of wrangles being duplicated across the entire company as senior management attempt to fuse two corporations with such widely different roots. BT began as a government-owned monopoly while MCI cut its teeth fighting a onetime monopoly, AT&T. BT controls 90 percent of the British market while MCI has struggled for 20 percent of the U.S. long-distance market. The size of the combined company makes some worry that MCI's nimbleness and aggressiveness will be lost. The new Concert will be one of the three largest telephone companies in the world, with revenues of $42 billion, 183,000 employees and a pro-forma market capitalisation of $54 billion. "Customers will expect a lot more from MCI now it is on an equal footing with AT&T. It will be harder for MCI to retain that scrappy, upstart image," said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom. Potential flashpoints could be the need to use BT billing and support systems to help pry open the $90 billion a year U.S. local calling markets. Though MCI has advanced billing systems, it has never had to cope with this scale of attack. A second may be international calling. BT and MCI plan to replicate calling plans like MCI's Friends and Family, which was used to great effect within the United States, to cement customer ties on both sides of the Atlantic. "There are plans in the works for that sort of thing," said the BT insider, who declined to be identified. But BT has never had to administer calling plans of the complexity that MCI has used, which generate a very high level of customer service queries. The two companies also plan to use Britain as a conduit for grabbing international business calling from continental Europe and route it through London to the United States. Another major issue is what type of technology to use to bring Internet and multimedia applications to U.S. homes. BT is expected to be closely involved as a pioneer in so-called broadband technologies. "That is going to be a major decision," MCI's Briggs said. Even though the top executives work very well together, they do not always have perfect judgment. Briere said MCI's two biggest previous alliances, a $2 billion media alliance with News Corp. and the $1 billion takeover of Canada's SHL Systemhouse, both in 1995, have not produced the benefits expected. "Both News Corp. and SHL have failed to meet investment expectations," said Briere.

CCAT	The Porgera Joint Venture said on Thursday that the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea had restarted milling operations at half capacity following recent light rains. Milling of about 7,000 tonnes of ore a day started on June 18 using water reserves held in the Waile Creek Dam, it said.   "Water reserves in the Waile Creek dam are sufficient for seven days milling at the 7,000 tonnes per day throughput rate," it said. Dry weather forced the suspension of milling operations at the mine in PNG's remote highlands on June 1. High grade stockpiles would now be preferentially treated to offset lost production, estimated at around 40,000 ounces, while the mill was closed, it said. Efforts to improve the holding capacity of the dam would continue, with the aim of avoiding future water shortages, the joint venture said.   Milling operations could return to normal throughput rates of about 14,000 tonnes a day in coming weeks provided there was more rain, it said. The partners in the joint venture are operator Placer Dome Inc with 50 percent, 25 percent shareholder Goldfields Ltd, the PNG government-controlled Orogen Minerals Ltd with 15 percent and the government of Papua New Guinea with 10 percent. The mine produced 232,164 ounces of gold in the first quarter of calendar 1997 and produces in the order of one million ounces each year. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800

MCAT	NYCE cotton closed weaker but off the lows amid steady commercial buying, trading sources said. Speculative selling pressured the benchmark December contract to the day's low of 74.65 cents after the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a disappointing export and sales report. The USDA put new sales for the week ended July 24 at 86,600 480-lb bales. Exports were 81,900 bales. December held over its downside target of 74.00 cents, however, as many players remain reluctant to take positions ahead of the USDA's monthly supply and demand estimates, released August 12. An estimated 8,000 lots changed hands compared with Wednesday's official 3,962 lots. The December contract closed 0.31 cent lower at 75.05 cents a lb, having ranged from 75.30 to 74.65 cents. The rest of the board ended 0.49 cent to 0.03 cent lower. ((Suzanne Rostler, New York Commodity Desk, 212-859-1640))
GCAT	A leading congressional critic of the way the Air Force handled the Kelly Flinn adultery case said Friday the military needs to review its policies on fraternisation and enforcement. "The entire armed services has to review their military policies, their policies on fraternisation, their policies of enforcement, and move forward," Representative Nita Lowey, Democrat of New York, said in an interview with the Cable News Network. The lawmaker also said the military's rules on sexual conduct were not in line with what goes on in society. "They certainly don't conform to what most of us see in the norms of life and that's why we need an entire review," she said. "It just doesn't make any sense." Her remarks came one day after Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall announced that Flinn, the nation's first female B-52 bomber pilot, had been given a general discharge and would leave the service instead of being court-martialed on charges that she committed adultery, lied during an official investigation and disobeyed a direct order. The discharge would prevent Flinn from flying planes for the Air Force Reserve or the Air National Guard unless she obtained a waiver, which Flinn's attorney, Frank Spinner, said she would seek. Flinn, 26 and single, will also have to repay $18,000 in tuition fees that the government gave her to attend the prestigious Air Force Academy. Lowey also said there was a randomness to the way in which the military enforced its policies and said the armed services should be consistent in the way it carries out its rules. "As you look at all the cases, there was a randomness with which the armed services enforced their policies," Lowey said. "There was no consistency. "The real problem here originally," she added, "was that Kelly Flinn was not given an administrative review and that it was going to court-martial. It would have been better if there had been an administrative review and it wasn't a public spectacle to begin with." Lowey was one of several members of Congress who criticised the Air Force over its handling of the case. When asked by CNN if it was appropriate for Congress to get involved in the matter, Lowey replied: "I don't think it was inappropriate. The fact that members of Congress got involved was a good thing."
GCAT	The last time anyone saw dissident union leader Gregorio Alfonso Alvarado alive was on Sept. 26 when he left a meeting of a local opposition group to pick up his wife from work. As the troubled state of Guerrero voted on Sunday in local elections, Alfonso was still missing -- a growing symbol of the troubled times in this southwestern Mexican state. His wife, Norma Lorena Valdez, who is on the sixth day of a hunger strike to press the government to return her husband alive, believes Alfonso is being held by shadowy government security forces for allegedly supporting the Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR), a new guerrilla group. Also on hunger strike are six members of Alfonso's teachers' union. Valdez said her husband had received anonymous threats accusing him of being a subversive. She said three men in an unmarked car had been following him for weeks, taking pictures of the family nearly every day. Alfonso's Union of State Education Workers (CETEG) is part of a larger grass-roots opposition movement known as the FAC-MLN, a national umbrella group of dissident organisations that has been accused by government officials of supporting the EPR. State spokesman Roberto Alvarez said the government was looking into the Alfonso case. Human rights groups said the Alfonso case was the latest crackdown against opposition groups by the military and local government. David Fernandez, director of Mexico City-based Miguel Agustin Pro human rights group, said the army has illegally detained dozens of peasant farmers and opposition politicians in the past weeks in search of EPR rebels, who have killed dozens of people in sporadic attacks on military and police posts. Most of those arrested were freed hours later. Another CETEG union member, Pedro Eligio Cabanas, was grabbed by state police in front of the state government building last week and taken to jail, where he was beaten and later released. Police said they mistook him for wanted felon.
ECAT	UK capital expenditure by the manufacturing industries fell by two percent in the third quarter from the second and was 16 percent lower than the third quarter of 1995, revised figures from the Office for National Statistics showed. The third quarter figure totalled 2,736 million stg. The ONS said revised estimates of capital expenditure for other production rose by 3 percent, services by 1 percent while construction fell by 33 per cent over the previous quarter. Other production fell by 4 percent, services rose by 2 percent and construction fell by 28 percent over Q3 l995. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 5109
MCAT	IPE Brent closed firm on Friday, touching new highs shortly before the close, with a dogged ascent in afternoon trade underpinned by ongoing Iraqi tensions, brokers said. IPE Oct Brent closed up 38 cents at $22.54 a barrel, having flirted with a session high of $22.60 three times in the last half hour of trading. "It wasn't as spectacular as gas oil, but we were getting nitty gritty support from Iraq headlines," said one IPE floor broker.   U.N. diplomats said on Friday that implemenation of Iraq's food-for-oil plan was currently difficult after Baghdad's military attack on Kurdish zones in northern Iraq. "We saw some good trade buying into the close, but the volumes weren't that great," said a broker. The Oct/Nov spread closed one cents down at +64 cents a barrel. IPE gas oil, buoyed by its own strong fundamentals, accelerated further away from crude on Friday. Sept gas oil settled $7 a tonne up at $219.75, 75 cents off the day's high.   The Sep/Oct backwardation settled at $9.25, having narrowed from a gulf of $11.75 earlier in the session. The Oct Brent/gas oil crack spread closed firmer at $5.76 a barrel. Brokers said that supply tightness in northwest Europe had sparked fears of a shortage of prompt material for delivery against the screen when the Sep contract expires next Thursday. "Gas oil is a different story, a (trading house) is taking advantage of tight fundamentals to go for the squeeze," said one dealer.   Forty percent of the European Union gas oil pool will change over to 0.05 percent sulphur on October 1. Brokers said that this was causing a natural supply tightness for 0.2 percent material, which the IPE will continue to quote. --Rosalind Russell, London Newsroom +44 171 542 5387
GCAT	Mexican ex-president Carlos Salinas, who lives in exile in Ireland, answered more than 300 questions in a 12-hour interrogation by prosecutors looking into the 1994 killing of a top Mexican politician, the special prosecutor heading the probe said on Thursday. "It was, in fact, 12 long hours of questioning," Luis Raul Gonzalez Perez told national radio live from Dublin where Salinas testified on Wednesday in the Mexican Embassy. "There were a little over 300 questions...and he answered them all," he said, adding that the former leader stayed calm and collected throughout the grilling, without a lawyer present, by a five-man investigating team. Salinas also read out a prepared statement which spelled out the political situation and his relations with Luis Donaldo Colosio, his hand-picked choice to run for president for the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Gonzalez Perez said. Colosio was assassinated on March 23, 1994, at the end of a rally in the northern border city of Tijuana -- a murder that rocked the nation and still has the government probing to find who was behind the killing. One man is serving a 45-year sentence for the killing but prosecutors believe his death was the result of a conspiracy involving other people. Salinas left Mexico in disgrace in March 1995 after his elder brother was arrested on murder charges in a separate case. Gonzalez Perez said Salinas' statement sought to dispell the view that his relations with Colosio soured in the weeks before the murder and that Salinas even tried to force him to step down from the candidacy. Colosio's death catapulted his campaign manager, Ernesto Zedillo, into the PRI candidacy and Zedillo easily won August 1994 presidential elections. No PRI candidate has lost a presidential race since the party's formation in 1929. Gonzalez Perez, refusing to give specific details of answers that Salinas made, said the focus of the investigation on Salinas was as a witness, not as a suspect. "It (the questioning) was from the point of view as a witness...because he can have information," Gonzalez Perez said, though he said Salinas was asked if he knew who was involved and if he was behind the assassination. Opposition politicians, many convinced that Salinas was involved in the killing, had demanded that the former president be brought back to Mexico to testify in the case. Salinas has denied any involvement in the assassination and went on a brief hunger strike in March last year to demand that authorities make clear he was not a suspect. He has suggested the murder was the work of the PRI's old guard "dinosaurs," who do not want the country to modernise. Gonzalez Perez avoided radio questions on the content of Salinas's answers. The former president's testimony and prepared statement will be added to mountains of documents accumulated in the 980 days since the Colosio killing, the special prosecutor said. "Right now, it is a little premature to say if another questioning (of Salinas) will be required," Gonzalez Perez said. The special prosecutor returns to Mexico later Thursday.
ECAT	First Union Capital Markets Corp., said it won $6.600 million of Robertson Cty, Tenn., general obligation school bonds, Series 1996, with a true interest cost of 4.90 percent.
MCAT	The Czech PX50 index rose sharply on Wednesday pushed by strong gains for SPT Telecom and especially power utility CEZ. The PX50 index rose by 1.7 percent to 580.1 and the major issue dominated RPIX index of continuously traded shares rose 2.3 percent to 1,218.4. In the previous session dealers had noted that supply was extremely low for SPT Telecom and CEZ, and had therefore predicted gains in subsequent sessions. However, Wednesday's moves, which saw CEZ gain 5.4 percent to 1,159 and SPT rise 3.1 percent to 3,575, were considered by dealers to have been speculative and probably overdone. "There was some speculation that some new money was coming into the market...it might have been the reason (for CEZ's rise)," said Ivan Kusacek of Zivnostenska Banka adding that similar rumours may have pushed up SPT as well. Although CEZ and SPT posted the most spectacular gains of the day, Komercni Banka which rose by a more modest 11 crowns to 2,500, attracted more interest. Komercni's trade turnover on the RPIX index at 21.4 million crowns was almost double the combined turnover of the two utilities.
CCAT	Penang Shipbuilding and Construction Ltd of Malaysia has paid $4.2 million for 60 percent of shares in Ghana's Tema Shipyard and Drydock Corp, a Malaysian company official said. Sulaiman Matjam, Penang's acting manager in Ghana told Reuters his company took over the Tema shipyard on January 1. The government of Ghana retained 40 percent of shares in company, renamed PSC Tema Shipyard Ltd. "We have the obligation to invest at least $5.5 million in two years. We will expand activities. We are going to be involved in ship building, oil and gas works, heavy fabrication of amongst others container cranes, like we do in Malaysia," Matjam said. The oil and gas works will include pipelines for natural gas projects in Ghana and other countries in the region. The shipyard's main assets are a 100,000-tonne and a 30,000-tonne drydock, both built in 1968. "Those two docks are sufficient for the African market. We will upgrade the facilities of the dry dock and send Ghanaian staff to Malaysia for extensive training," said Matjam. PSC targets a 100 percent increase of turnover within two years to $10 million from the current $5 million, he said. The Tema yard is now only involved in ship repair, mostly merchant vessels, but the new company will also refurbish Ghanaian navy vessels. -- Abidjan newsroom: +225 21 90 90
ECAT	Both headline and core UK inflation is expected to have crept higher in October, as rising energy prices and growing demand pressures took their toll on the British economy, analysts said on Tuesday. But a number of offsetting factors such as persistently weak producer prices and cheaper imports in the wake of sterling's recent appreciation, make the extent of the rise hard to predict, they added. According to a Reuter poll, economists expect the retail price index, due at 0930 GMT on Thursday, to have fallen 0.2 percent in October from the previous month, giving a 2.5 percent annual rate, up on September's 2.1 percent rate. RPIX core inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, is seen edging further away from the government's inflation target in October, creeping up to 3.1 percent from 2.9 percent in September. RPIY, exculding mortgage payments and indirect taxes, is seen rising to 2.9 percent from 2.5 percent last month. "There's a genuine amount of uncertainty about the data," said J.P.Morgan economist David Mackie. "It reflects the fact there's a lot of things going on and you can't be confident when they'll show up in the retail price index." Economists said the data would do nothing to reassure increasingly sceptical investors that the government will meet its 2.5 percent RPIX inflation target by the end of the year. Among the factors expected to exert upward pressure on the RPI is the recent hike in oil prices which will continue to make its way to the petrol pump in October. "We know that retail gasoline prices have gone up by around 10 percent since July, but only around half of that had shown up in the RPI by September," said Mackie. "If the rest shows up in October it would add about two-tenths to the year-on-year inflation rate." Jonathan Loynes, economist at HSBC markets, said house price rises and seasonal food inflation may also be negative factors for inflation in October. "Accordingly, the next few months are likely to see underlying inflation move further away from the government's one to 2.5 percent target range," said Loynes. But Bank of America economist Jeremy Hawkins was more sanguine about inflationary pressures in October, arguing that recent price rises have proved unsustainable. "So far, each time we've....seen price hikes coming through for whatever category, it's been associated with a fall off in demand...leading to the unwinding of the price hike in subsequent months," he said. Clothing and footwear prices rose 5.2 percent in September, the largest rise since records began in 1947. Retail sales data for the same month showed footwear sales dropped by 12 percent in value terms. "In many ways this month will be a litmus test as to the genuine strength of underlying demand. It may be that retailers are finding the recovery sufficiently strong so they can begin to widen margins. It's going to come I think, but not yet," Hawkins said. He said weak producer price data in October suggested pipeline pressures remained almost non-existent, while sterling's appreciation against the dollar has helped dampen the effects of the oil price rise.   Economists were split as to whether October's price data would increase the pressure on the Chancellor to raise interest rates before the next election. "I think Clarke will have to put rates up one more time early next year. Then whoever wins the election is going to have to put them up pretty aggressively after the election," said J.P.Morgan's Mackie. -- London newsroom +44 171 542 7708
CCAT	The Woolwich Building Society, which on Wednesday announced its last set of results before a planned stock market flotation, said it sees growth in all its businesses. But Chief Executive John Stewart said that if draft building societies legislation is passed in its current form, the Woolwich would have to consider expansion by acquisition very carefully. This is because in its current form the law would take away a building society's five-year immunity from takeover, which they enjoy under present legislation, if they take over another financial sector company.
MCAT	COMEX copper futures were seen opening lower Wednesday, in line with LME copper after a rise in LME warehouse copper stocks. COMEX July copper was seen opening down 0.30 to 0.80 cent a pound from the previuos close at 109.55 cents, after trading a 109.70-108.30 cent range in overnight ACCESS trade. LME copper stocks rose 2,675 tonnes Wednesday to 143,750 tonnes, while COMEX stocks slipped 1,235 short tons Tuesday to 50,885 short tons. COMEX copper prices have been drifted back this week from a test of the eight month highs seen in early March. The May/July spread has fallen back to around 1.0 cent a pound from 2.5 cents last week and the LME cash-to-three month spread has eased also to around $69.00 a tonne Thursday from around $200 a tonne last week. But the bullish consensus remains high around 70 percent, according to analysts Market Vane Corp of California. ((Clive McKeef, New York Commodities Desk, 212-859-1641))
GCAT	The top aide to former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was indicted Tuesday on criminal charges of making false statements to conceal the receipt of almost $22,000 in outside consulting fees earned after he joined Espy's staff. Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz announced that Ronald Blackley, chief of staff for Espy while he served on President Clinton's cabinet, was charged with three separate counts of making false statements to federal investigators and in financial reports to hide income that was not allowed under government ethics rules. The indictment marked the first criminal charges against a member of Espy's staff in the government's 30-month investigation of the former Clinton cabinet member. Observers of the lengthy investigation said the indictment will put greater pressure on Espy. "It is a standard tool for a prosecutor to indict a second-in-command to get information on the person at the top," said Georgetown University law professor Paul Rothstein. "Things are looking progressively less good for Mr. Espy." Rothstein noted, however, that in many cases the indictment of a senior aide stops at that level if prosecutors cannot prove any wrongdoing by his superior, and that it is premature to say an Espy indictment was a "sure thing." Blackley's attorney Hiram Eastland accused the independent counsel of a witch-hunt. "Mr. Smaltz has persecuted Mr. Blackley's family members, his friends, and it appears he will stop at nothing," said Eastland, an attorney in Jackson, Mississippi. If found guilty of the charges, Blackley could be sentenced to up to five years' imprisonment for each count and be fined a total of $750,000. The indictment charges Blackley with "knowingly and wilfully" making false statements on three separate occassion and failing to report fees he had received from farmer clients of his for helping them obtain monetary subsidies from the Agriculture Department. Before joining Espy's staff, Blackley ran a consulting business in which, among other things, he helped producers get federal subsidies from the farm agency. Espy has been under investigation since late 1994 for allegedly accepting illegal gifts and favours while he was agriculture secretary from companies his agency regulated. The original allegations against Espy, a former congressman from Mississippi, stemmed from gifts he took from Arkansas-based Tyson Foods Inc., the nation's biggest poultry processor whose senior chairman Don Tyson has long enjoyed close ties with Clinton, former governor of Arkansas. Tyson is also a focus of the federal investigation. Espy has been charged with giving preferential treatment to Tyson Foods, and other companies, in return for gifts and favours. Blackley has been mentioned in the Espy controversy since its beginning. According to published reports in 1993, while he was Espy's senior aide, Blackley delayed plans by the Agriculture Department to enforce stricter safety standards for poultry processors, due largely to objections from Tsyon officials. Blackley also allegedly helped obtain over $700,000 in federal farm subsidy payments to Mississippi farmer and long-time Espy supporter Brook Mitchell. Mitchell last September pleaded guilty to conspiracy and defrauding the government of the payments. Blackley was an unindicted co-conspirator in the Mitchell case. An official in Smaltz's office said the investigation of Espy and Tyson "is still active," and repeated statements made earlier this year by the Independent Counsel that the team hopes to complete the investigative work by "early summer."
CCAT	Debt rating agency Standard & Poor's said on Tuesday it had revised the long-term corporate credit outlook of Sodexho Alliance , formerly Sodexho, to stable from negative. It reaffirmed its A minus rating on senior unsecured and A2 short-term corporate credit, S&P said in a statement. S&P also affirmed the triple-B senior unsecured debt rating of Financiere Sodexho which owns 45.2 percent of Sodexho Alliance. The ratings confirmation and change in outlook reflects Sodexho's ability to quickly restore its financial profile after the successful acquisitions of Gardner Merchant and Partena. The acquisitions almost doubled Sodexho's sales in 1995 and temporarily stretched its financial profile, S&P said. S&P expects further improvement in Sodexho's financial profile thanks to its good growth prospects and strong free cashflow generation. The main feature of Sodexho's finances is the low capital intensity of its businesses, as reflected in low operating margins and above-average returns on capital. The company will continue to benefit from steady free cashflow to finance internal growth, pay large dividends to family shareholders and cut debt further. In the fiscal year ending August 31, Sodexho's net debt totalled 2.1 billion francs, down 33 percent from the 3.1 billion from a year earlier after the acquisition of Gardner Merchant of Britain for 6.1 billion francs. -- Paris newsroom +331 4221 5452
MCAT	MGE spring wheat futures ended mixed and off their lows on short covering brought about by a rally in CBOT corn and soybeans, traders said. Wheat was firm early but turned lower at the midsession as the EU dropped its tax on daily wheat exports, raising fears about a resumption of export subsidies, traders said. "Essentially there was no real conviction either way today -- we saw overhead selling on the rally and below-market pricing on the break," a trader said. "Only reason we were able to have any short covering was because of what happened with the rally in corn and beans." Traders said Benson-Quinn sold one million Dec and bought 600,000 Dec bushels. LFG sold 1.5 million Dec and sold 800,000 Dec. ADM reportedly bought 500,000 Dec. MGE spring wheat closed 5-1/4 cents per bushel lower to 4-1/2 cents higher, with Sept down 5-1/4 cents at $4.37-3/4. Dec gained 1/2 cent to close at $4.20-1/2. MGE feed barley futures did not trade and therefore settled unchanged. The MGE estimated spring wheat volume at 19.767 million bushels, versus Wednesday's volume of 29.155 million. --Greg Frost, 816 561-8671

GCAT	Austrian security chiefs sought help from U.S. and European intelligence codebusters on Wednesday after threats by suspected rightwing extremists to blow up prominent figures in Austria and abroad. The Austrian government and security officials stressed they were forced to take seriously a warning by a group calling itself the Bajuvarian Liberation Army (BLA) to target eight prominent people, including Chancellor Franz Vranitzky. Security around Vranitzky was visibly tightened on Tuesday after it emerged that the chancellor's name appeared on a list of targets attached to a 20-page letter sent by the BLA to current affairs magazine Profil. Officials have not disclosed other names on the list but say the threat may be linked to campaigning ahead of European parliamentary and Vienna state elections on October 13. "We are in contact with security services in the United States, Germany and other European states," an interior ministry spokeswoman told Reuters. Austrian television showed parts of the letter which include pages crammed with what appeared to be numbered codes. "We have already sent this letter to the (U.S.) National Security Agency (NSA) but it is too early to say whether it will be able to break the codes," she added. The NSA, a separately organised agency within the U.S. Defense Department, is America's foremost cryptological body, employing the nation's premier codemakers and codebreakers. Government sources have indicated that the BLA may be a group of middle-aged fanatics believed to be obsessed with reuniting German-speaking peoples in Bavaria, the Alps and the Danube River -- a distinct region which existed between the sixth and 12th centuries. The BLA has claimed responsibility for more than 20 letter bombs directed against foreigners and figures linked to immigrant or refugee issues since 1993. Eleven people have been injured in the attacks in Austria and Germany. In a possibly connected incident, four gypsy men were killed in a bomb blast in February last year. The bombing campaign has baffled police and security forces, who have come under stiff public criticism for failing to put anyone behind bars despite questioning thousands of people over the past three years. Bodyguards flanked Vranitzky on Tuesday during a visit to Vienna by Leah Rabin, widow of assassinated Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. Normally security around politicians is low-key in Austria and bodyguards remain on the periphery. Security officials said they were taking the latest threat more seriously because the BLA referred for the first time only to bomb attacks and not specifically to letter bombs. The BLA letter used racist language to describe Vranitzky, who has Czech ancestry, calling him a "Slav chief and devourer of Germans". Austrian daily Der Standard published part of the letter which said the latest threat was connected with jail terms handed out to two self-confessed neo-Nazis, Peter Binder and Franz Radl. The two men were the only suspects held for the first wave of letter bombs launched in December 1993, in which former Vienna mayor Helmut Zilk was injured. They were acquitted last December of those charges but jailed for eight years for neo-Nazi activities. The number of eight targets was believed to represent the eight-year jail terms. Die Kronen Zeitung newspaper said the codes included in the letter indicated that the BLA may include a former member of Austria's secret service among its ranks.
CCAT	An aerospace team headed by Boeing Co has been awarded a $1.1 billion contract to develop a U.S. military airborne laser to destroy tactical ballistic missiles in flight, the Air Force said on Tuesday. The Boeing team, which includes Lockheed Martin Corp and TRW Inc, will develop a prototype laser to be mounted on a Boeing 747 aircraft in the next six years to see if it can burn up short and medium-range missiles right after they are launched.   The Boeing team defeated a team headed by Rockwell International Corp. That team included General Motors Corp's Hughes aircraft division and the E-Systems unit of Raytheon Corp. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Ronald Fogelman announced the award at a Pentagon news conference. He called the technology for the chemical laser "cutting edge" and said it could change the way the military thinks about defence. While the initial work would be worth $1.1 billion, it could eventually mean tens of billions for the winning team if the space age weapon can protect troops and bases against missiles carrying nuclear, biologicaol, chemical or conventional warheads. If milestones are met by the winning team in the coming years, a test model of the chemical laser is expected to make an attempt around the year 2002 to shoot down a missile at a range of more than 60 miles (100 km).
GCAT	U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright cancelled a two-day visit to Cambodia on Wednesday because of security concerns and her spokesman urged the country's leaders to redouble efforts to reduce tension. "The secretary has decided not to travel to Phnom Penh on this trip," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters flying with Albright to start an Asian tour. She was starting the tour in Vietnam and it also includes Hong Kong. "After several days of consultations with Cambodian leaders and U.S. security experts she felt the security situation...would not permit the type of visit she wants," Burns said. Burns called the Cambodian security environment "serious and unpredictable" as a reult of recent political tension that resulted in a fighting on June 17 between bodyguards loyal to the two rival co-premiers. As a result Albright will stay an extra day in Hanoi, the first stop on her trip, and arrive in Hong Kong on Saturday, a day earlier than planned, for ceremonies marking the July 1 transfer of the British colony to Chinese control.
GCAT	Russian President Boris Yeltsin is doing paperwork at his country holiday retreat and plans no meetings with officials on Friday, his press service said. A spokesman said Yeltsin had started preparing for a meeting with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl set for September 7. Yeltsin's wife Naina, meanwhile, was recovering at a Moscow hospital after a kidney operation last Saturday and would leave the clinic next week. The spokesman said he could not confirm a report by Itar-Tass news agency that Yeltsin had spoken by telephone with his security supremo Alexander Lebed before Lebed departed for rebel Chechnya early on Friday. The Kremlin said Yeltsin, 65, began his holiday on Monday at a hunting lodge formerly used by Soviet leaders some 100 km (60 miles) northwest of Moscow. Yeltsin, re-elected for a second term on July 3, has beena vbirtual recluse for the past two months, triggering speculation in the media and financial markets that he is ill or unable to control Russia's political situation. The Kremlin denies the rumours, saying he is merely tired after a tense election campaign. There have been no official reports that Yeltsin had met any of his aides during his holiday or spoken to them by telephone. The Kremlin said he had spoken to Kohl.
MCAT	Norwegian shares, hit by the summer lull, ended flat on Monday in thin trade, with just four companies accounting for almost 50 percent of the session's turnover. Oslo's Total share index ended a slim 0.02 percent up at 1,178.03 points in turnover of just 686 million crowns. Telecommunications group NetCom accounted for 110 million crowns of trade after a single block of 900,000 shares traded in one post. The stock closed unchanged at 80 crowns. Dealers said it was unclear who was behind the sale but it was likely that a Swedish bank was involved in the deal. Anglo-Norwegian construction and engineering group Kvaerner moved higher in brisk early trade following a report in the British media on Sunday that the company was in talks with a billionaire Saudi investor to sell the Cunard flagship cruise operator. Kvaerner declined to comment on the report. Kvaerner's A share hit an intraday high at 433 crowns before slipping back to finish at 428.50 crowns in trade of 80.3 million crowns. Rig company Ocean Rig gained almost six percent to 10.50 crowns after the group announced it had signed a deal with Saga Petroleum for its first fifth generation rig.

ECAT	Contrary to some opinions that Russia is in economic crisis, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said on Monday that he felt there were signs of real progress in its efforts to reform its economy. In a speech prepared for delivery to the U.S.-Russia Business Council, Summers said Russia "lies at a critical juncture" and needs to toughen the rule of law and cut state participation in the economy to curb corruption. But Summers cited as progress the shift of nearly 70 percent of Russian production into private hands, which he described as "the largest transfer of assets in history."   Wages have risen fivefold in the past four years and inflation has been under one percent a month for each of the past three months, Summers said. Russia now needs growth to keep its economy stabilised and he said that would be greatly helped by the state taking steps to strengthen the rule of law and reform the tax system. Taxes now are applied in a discriminatory way by multiple tax authorities and sometimes soak up more than 100 percent of profits, Summers said.
CCAT	Nomura Securities Co Ltd will hold an extraordinary board of directors' meeting on Tuesday to decide on company president Masashi Suzuki's resignation, Jiji news agency reported.   A company spokesman said he could not confirm the report. "We have a regular management meeting joined by senior executives every Tuesday and it will be held this afternoon," he said. However, he said that he did not know whether Nomura would hold an extraordinary board of directors' meeting later in the day. Jiji said Nomura would decide on a sweeping restructuring of its senior management. It said that Junichi Ujiie or Toshiaki Ito, both managing directors, were in line to become president. Suzuki added the post of president to his position as chairman on March 14 after former president Hideo Sakamaki stepped down to take responsibility for a scandal involving suspected illegal stock deals. The Japanese economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported in its evening edition that Nomura's five executive vice presidents and four executive managing directors would lose some of their privileges as a result of the scandal.
ECAT	A key economic forecasting gauge posted its largest increase in eight months in January, a business research group said Tuesday, suggesting economic growth will accelerate during the first half of the year. The Conference Board said its index of leading indicators -- designed to forecast economic activity six to nine months ahead -- rose 0.3 percent in January after a 0.1 percent gain in December. The January increase was the largest since a 0.3 percent rise last May.   During the six months ended in January, the index increased 0.7 percent. The Conference Board, a private business research group, said that six of the 10 components in the leading index rose in January. The largest contributors were factory orders for new consumer goods, weekly claims for state unemployment insurance, the difference between short- and long-term interest rates, stock prices, and growth in the nation's money supply. The most significant negative contributors were faster supplier delivery of goods -- indicating fewer bottlenecks -- and a shorter factory workweek. The report backs up other evidence suggesting the economy may be gathering steam. Purchasing managers reported on Monday that activity in the manufacturing sector speeded up in February.
MCAT	Some defensive action may be taken by investors on Thursday which will drag the FTSE 100 index down to about 4,665 before it can try to stabilise, technical analysts said. But various technical indicators suggest the market's resilience may be strained over the near-term, they added. Over the past six days, it has shown a sturdy performance, which has created an upwardly sloping channel with trendlines going up at an average rate of 10 points per day. These trendlines connect the FTSE's intra-day highs and lows since May 20. "But on Wednesday, the FTSE closed near the lower part of this channel and a close below this will signal weaker times ahead (short-term)," said one analyst. By 0705 GMT, the FTSE was indicated unchanged at 4,677.5. The market will again display its unsettled nature of recent days by tooing-and-froing within a 30 point range which so far has had the effect of gently pulling down its 10 day moving average. "This may also indicate diminishing upward forces in the market," said the analyst. On Wednesday, the average closed at 4,663. But one positive factor which could help provide UK equities with ballast and character will be if yields in the bonds market start falling sharply. "This does not seem imminent so that for the short-term, the FTSE will continue to stumble -- but may refuse to take a dive," said the analyst. On Wednesday, the 10 year benchmark gilt yield went up 0.07 percent to 7.22 percent. -- Pradip Mishra, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7954
MCAT	Austrian shares ended soft on Tuesday but off early lows due to a boost from futures-linked buying and selective interest in several blue chips. Traders said the ATX index of 21 blue chips is well supported at 1,065 points and see it next trying for 1,080. The ATX closed 2.9 points, or 0.27 percent, lower at 1,070.63 after earlier slipping to 1,065.78. Eight shares gained, 12 fell and one was unchanged. "Let's see today as a breather for the market. The next target is 1,080 points," said one trader. Traders cited selective buying interest in chip-maker AMS, Creditanstalt's ordinary shares, brewing giant BBAG and VA Stahl. The day's best performer was AMS, jumping 5.05 percent to 874. Traders said the chip-maker was bought on growing belief it could manage a turnaround at its two loss-making acquisitions SAMES and Thesys. Wolford continued to see demand after Monday's stock split, adding on 15 schillings to 1,365. Cartonboard manufacturer Mayr-Melnhof was the leading decliner, shedding 3.2 percent to close at 545. The broad-based Vienna bourse index fell 0.67 points, or 0.16 percent, to 412.54. The October ATX future gained 1.6 points to 1,072.6 on turnover of 886 contracts.
MCAT	Short-term trading rates on Zimbabwe's money market were quoted lower on the back of liquidity in active trade on Tuesday, dealers said. "The market is quite active at the moment. There're a number of maturities adding liquidity to the system," said a dealer. He said the central Reserve Bank, forecasting a market surplus of Z$640 million at the end of the day, had already taken off Z$550 million by selling 91-day treasury bills to discount houses at 16.47 percent. The central bank paper was being sold on the secondary market at 16.35 percent, down from Monday's 16.50 percent.

Bankers acceptance bills were being bought at 17 percent and sold at 16.50 percent. Figures from the Reserve Bank showed the market closed with a Z$44 million deficit on Monday, from a previous surplus of Z$39.6 million. --Stella Mapenzauswa, Harare Newsroom: +263-4 72 52 27/8/9
MCAT	Yen futures were once again the most popular contracts on a slow Budapest Commodity Exchange (BCE) forex futures market, with deferred maturities in focus, dealers said on Thursday. The yen accounted for half of the BCE's low turnover of 2.3 billion forints. Dealers said current talk out of Tokyo of possible Bank of Japan intervention to stop the yen's fall against the dollar had maintained interest in long-term contracts in the Japanese currency. Most deals were for March 1998, which rose 75 fillers to 167.20 per 100 yen. The mark which has also suffered recent losses aganst the rampaging dollar also attracted interest, mainly for September, which rose 14 fillers to 112.45 forints. The Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE) saw very thin currency futures turnover of 58.7 million forints, all for the September dollar, which rose 38 fillers to 195.71 forints. The BSE trades only in marks, dollars and Ecus. Central bank spot rates for the yen, mark and dollar were fixed at midday at 142.64 forints per 100 yen, up 0.47, 104.83 forints to the mark, up 0.05, and 174.84 to the dollar, up 0.10. -- Duncan Shiels, Budapest newsroom +36 1 327-4040
ECAT	South African bank credit extension was seen slowing in the second half of this year but could continue to be a barrier to interest rate cuts, the University of Stellenbosch's Bureau for Economic Research said. "It is difficult to get to the bottom on the persistent high growth of bank credit extension," BER said in its latest economic update. "Distress borrowing by private individuals and business financing of involuntary stocks have been proffered as driving factors. Export related business and fixed investment could be another factor." Given lower retail and wholesale sales in the first two months of 1997, however, it was likely that bank credit extension could slow down to more acceptable levels in the second half of the year, it said. "Combined with lower inflation and an improved balance of payments, the way could be paved for lower interest rates," BER said. "The key risk factor contained in this view is persistently high growth of bank credit extension. This could lead to the retention of a restrictive monetary policy for longer." As the continued strength of the rand was not certain, exports could still perform well and counter the mild two percent forecast in real gross domestic expenditure resulting in overall gross domestic product growth of 3.1 percent in 1997. "It, however, remains worthwhile to emphasise the risk of a stronger than expected exchange rate," BER said. "The first quarter overall export performance was somewhat disappointing." -- Cape Town newsroom +27 21 25-2238

MCAT	Tokyo stocks are likely to remain firm on Tuesday on expectations in the market that new inflows of money will come from domestic pension funds soon, brokers said. But profit-taking interest remains strong above 20,500 in the key index, and this is expected to limit the upside, they also said. On Monday, the Nikkei 225 average finished 152.72 points or 0.74 percent higher at 20,681.07, its highest close since finishing at 20,822.12 on December 10. September Nikkei futures rose 230 points to end at 20,820.   "The Nikkei 225 is likely to open higher, but people want to take profits above 20,500," said a broker at a second-tier Japanese securities house. "There seemed to be no buying from public pension funds that we had expected to happen yesterday, but there are still strong hopes for that," said an analyst at a second-tier Japanese securities house. Brokers also said that a newspaper report on Tuesday about an expected abolition of Japan's securities trading tax and a change in the capital gain tax would be a neutral factor and would support the market only slightly.
GCAT	The Hong Kong governemnt assured Chinese dissidents sheltering in the territory on Friday they would be granted the right to live here permanently despite China's resumption of sovereignty earlier this week. "Illegal immigrants granted stay in Hong Kong between July 1, 1990 and June 30, 1997 will be eligible for right of abode after having ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years if he or she is a Chinese citizen," a government statement said. Earlier one of four Chinese dissidents remaining in Hong Kong said they would challenge a law passed by the new China-picked legislature and press the government for the right to reside in the territory. Lu Siqing, a member of the Information Centre of Human Rights and the Democratic Movement in China, told Reuters he planned to send a letter to Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung, urging permanent residency for the last few dissidents. Lu, who came to Hong Kong in July 1993 to escape trial for his role in China's pro-democracy movement, is among the last of thousands of dissidents who fled the mainland after the bloody crackdown around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989. "I will send a letter to (Leung) and request permanent residency for the remaining four dissidents," Lu said. "If our request is rejected, I may take legal action to challenge the legitimacy of the Provisional Legislature as I am a citizen in Hong Kong and deem this legislature illegitimate." The Beijing-picked Provisional Legislature supplanted the elected Legislative Council at midnight on Monday when Britain handed back Hong Kong to China after 156 years of colonial rule. On June 7, before it was officially in power, the provisional chamber had passed a bill that illegal immigrants who have lived in Hong Kong for seven years must seek permission from the director of immigration for permanent right of abode. "No one, if they enter Hong Kong illegally, can get permanent residency in Hong Kong," Leung said after the June 7 session in the Chinese city of Shenzhen. "This does not mean we are targeting any group of people." Under British rule, the dissidents would automatically have been granted permanent residency after seven years. "I think this bill aims to deprive dissidents of their right of abode in Hong Kong," Lu said. "They are depriving me of my rights and I may take legal action to fight for that." Lu said he intends to stay in Hong Kong even if he cannot become a permanent resident because he wants to continue his work with the dissidents' support group and fight for human rights in the Chinese-run territory. Many of the dissidents who left Hong Kong for western countries said it was because they feared being harassed once China took over.
ECAT	Ten bank analysts polled by Reuters in a survey released on Tuesday predicted that Danish consumer confidence in July would be unchanged from the previous month at a high +10 points. The panel forecast an average +10 points, with seven predicting +10, two +11 and one +12, compared to only +3 in July 1996. "We cannot see anything which could reduce consumer confidence in the next few months. The high consumer confidence rate should hold until the autumn's political negotiations on the 1998 state budget," Codan Bank's senior economist Peter Schlaikjer told Reuters.

MCAT	The Czech PX50 index rose in low activity on Friday, the second to last trading day before the Christmas break. The PX50 was up 1.3 points to 529.8 while the RPIX index of continuously traded shares rose 2.8 points to 1,105.3. "The market was very quiet and nothing much happened," said Ivan Kusacek of Zivnostenska Banka in Prague. The Prague Stock Exchange will be open for business on Monday and Friday next week, while on the three intervening days it will close for Christmas. Dealers expect very little activity until after the New Year. The major issues were mixed. SPT Telecom and Komercni Banka posted small losses after making big gains earlier in the week. SPT fell two crowns to 3,295 while Komercni dropped 20 crowns to 2,180. Ceska Sporitelna was the biggest major issue gainer rising 10 crowns to 330 but Kusacek said it was difficult to asses the realsim of such a price in such thin trading. Power utility CEZ rose four crowns to 989. In the broader market, glass fibre maker Vertex continued its pattern of erratic fluctuations with a 167 crown decline to 3,185.

GCAT	A German couple arrested in Colombia while trying to free a woman kidnapped by leftist guerrillas has urged Colombian authorities to accept Bonn's help in mediating a peace treaty with the rebels. German private detective Werner Mauss and his wife Isabel Seidel were arrested in November as they tried to smuggle another German, Brigitte Schoene, out of Colombia three months after she was abducted by National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels. In a letter to a provincial governor, Seidel urged the authorities to let the German government help broker an end to guerrilla violence. A copy was sent to Reuters by the couple's lawyer on Friday. "If the German government has offered its help, then you should seize the opportunity because it will not come twice," Seidel wrote to Antioquia governor Alvaro Uribe, in the letter dated Christmas Eve. Seidel outlined the framework of a peace plan she said could be enacted over 10 years and said some of the proposals were floated at meetings in Germany last year attended by herself, Mauss, Colombian Interior Minister Horacio Serpa and Berd Schmidbauer, Germany's head of intelligence. The proposals included Colombian government payments to the ELN in return for the rebels suspending kidnappings and extorsion, agarian reforms and better infrastructure in areas where the guerrillas were most active. Colombian police accused Mauss and Seidel of being foreign members of the ELN, but the German government said they had been carrying out a "humanitarian" mission.

ECAT	U.S. Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor on Tuesday said that growth in the U.S. trade deficit with China this year has been slower than in recent years, "but it's still too high." Monthly figures released from the Commerce Department showed that the overall U.S. trade gap narrowed by 23.1 percent in June to $8.11 billion. But the figures also showed that for the first time, China had the largest monthly trade shortfall. The bilateral deficit jumped 8.8 percent to $3.33 billion in June.   That was larger than the June trade gap with Japan of $3.24 billion. Speaking to reporters following the release of the trade report, Kantor said the United States was "extremely resolute" in focusing on what he said was unfair discrimination by China U.S. imports. He said that focus would continue.
CCAT	British Airways Plc said Monday that its German regional carrier Deutsche BA placed an order to buy seven new Boeing 737 twinjets worth almost $300 million. The airline said the aircraft were being acquired under a deal with Deutsche Structured Finance, with all seven planes to be delivered this year, starting in August. Boeing said separately that the deal was valued at $287 million. BA said the new aircraft will be added to DBA's existing fleet of 10 737s and will replace its Fokker 100s for use on DBA's domestic services in single-class configuration. DBA currently flies seven domestic routes in Germany and three international routes to London's Gatwick airport.
GCAT	Deaths from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome declined 30 percent between 1992 and 1995, probably due to a simple change in babies' sleeping positions, the Department of Health and Human Services said on Wednesday. "This is a real cause for celebration. Because of our success in reducing SIDS, there were some 1,600 fewer deaths in 1995 than in 1992," Health Secretary Donna Shalala said in a statement. Shalala said a government programme called "Back to Sleep," which advocates putting infants to sleep on their backs or sides rather than on their stomachs, may well have made the difference. The American Academy of Pediatrics made the sleeping-position recommendation in 1992. Some recent studies have identified defects in the brain regions of SIDS infants that control breathing, the statement said. The cause of SIDS, defined as an unexplained and unexpected sudden death of an infant or small child, is unknown, but the HHS statistics are in line with other studies that show a decrease in SIDS when babies are put to sleep on their sides or backs.
ECAT	Total accumulated tax receipts in Portugal rose 28.4 percent year-on-year to 643 billion escudos in the first two months of 1997 from 500.8 billion in the same period of 1996, the finance ministry said in a statement. It said that when extraordinary effects were stripped out, the rate of increase was between nine and 10 percent, in line with 1997 budget forecasts. The extraordinary effects included receipts from the so-called Mateus Plan, which aims to recover tax and social security arrears from companies.-- Lisbon newsroom +(351-1) 3538254
ECAT	China's trade deficit with Taiwan is mounting and an influx of labour-intensive industries from the island is affecting China's trade balance with other partners, a newspaper said on Thursday. China's trade deficit with Taiwan rose by 5.8 percent in the first six months of 1996 to $5.67 billion from the year-earlier period, the International Business Times said. China's exports to Taiwan fell a year-on-year 15.8 percent to $1.28 billion between January and June, while imports from the island inched up 0.9 percent to $6.95 billion, the newspaper said. The newspaper said exports slipped and import growth slowed due in part to tensions in March, when China conducted war games and missile tests off Taiwan in the run-up to the island's historic direct presidential elections. Beijing and Taipei have been political rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, but China welcomes and encourages trade and investment with Taiwan. China's exports to Taiwan accounted for two percent of the nation's total exports in the first half of this year. Imports from Taiwan were 11 percent of total imports. Taiwan was China's sixth largest trading partner in the first six months, down from fifth place last year. Last month, China stepped up pressure on Taiwan to lift a decades-old ban on direct trade and transport links by unilaterally announcing a set of regulations to pave the way for such ties. Taiwan has banned direct trade, transport and mail links since 1949. Indirect trade and investment have been allowed since the late 1980s, usually through Hong Kong. Many Taiwanese business executives, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport, but Taiwan has been reluctant to remove the curbs, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists. The newspaper said China's imports from Taiwan consisted mainly of goods needed by foreign-funded enterprises or companies engaged in processing imported raw materials for re-export. The newspaper said that labour-intensive industries from Taiwan which were exporting from China were affecting the nation's trade balance with the United States and Europe. Much of the benefit from such manufacturing went to Taiwan and not China, it added. The newspaper said China's exports to Taiwan were expected to rebound in the second half of 1996 and that imports would grow at a faster pace than in the first half.
CCAT	An international share issue by Solidere, Lebanon's biggest company, fell short of its target but Beirut bankers said on Thursday the $77 million issue was a significant achievement. Solidere said the issue of Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) was oversubscribed but the company scaled back allocations, restricting them to medium- and long-term investors. "Subscription orders reached a total of $140 million from international investment funds and institutions," the company said in a statement. "A total sum of $77 million only of the total subscription orders was allocated to funds that follow a medium or long term investment policy," it added. According to market sources, Solidere had planned to issue 10 million GDRs worth $115-125 million, giving non-Arabs their first chance to invest in the company's reconstruction of Beirut's city centre. Instead, it sold 6.7 million GDRs at $11.50, each representing one-tenth of a Solidere A share. It was Solidere's first venture on the international market since its heavily oversubscribed $650 million share flotation in January 1994 which was limited to Lebanese and Arab investors. The issue was the first major deal out of Lebanon not targeted at Lebanese money abroad. Market sources said demand from the United States and Europe was "very strong." The GDRs were quoted on Thursday in London on SEAQ, the Stock Exchange Automated Quotations system, at $11.50-$11.70 but the underlying A shares fell in Beirut to $111.875 and $113.625 at the Beirut Stock Exchange's two fixings from $113 and $114.25 on Wednesday. Michel Aramouni of Banque Audi's Treasury and Capital Markets said Solidere achieved its target of issuing a large slice of GDRs to international investors not eligible under Lebanese law to buy the underlying shares. "In that sense it is a success but we can't talk about it as a hot issue," Aramouni said. A Beirut trader who asked not to be identified called the shortfall "a bit of a blow" but said that selling GDRs worth $77 million was a success in itself for Solidere. But another trader said: "The issue came in at the low end of the pricing and volume. Investors bought for $77 million and that's a significant amount, but it didn't go as well as expected." He said he was not convinced that Solidere did not allocate 100 percent of the demand in order to exclude hot investors who would take very quick profits. "I don't buy that too much, frankly," he said. Market sources said although the deal was heavily oversubscribed it was not sufficient to justify an issue of the size originally intended. "They wanted a position where there was after-market demand...In order to have sufficient after-market demand they didn't want people to get all the allocation they asked for. That's why they scaled back the issue," one source said. "The vast majority of the demand came from U.S. and European investors. This was a deal targetted at international investors and there was very strong demand among them," he added.
MCAT	The Copenhagen Stock Exchange on Friday reported an 11 percent fall in bond turnover during the first quarter of 1997, compared to the same period the previous year but a 13 percent year-on-year increase for the month of March. First quarter nominal turnover was 1,818 billion crowns and March trade amounted to 585.9 billion the exchange said in a statement. It said that government bonds were the most actively traded, with March turnover of 364.2 billlion crowns, of which the benchmark eight percent 2006 paper contributed 140.2 billion. The most actively traded mortgage credit bond was Nykredit's six percent 2026 contract, with a turnover of 15.6 billion crowns. First quarter share volume rose 58 percent year-on-year to 84.9 billion crowns and March trade was up 35 percent year-on-year to to 23.7 billion. Trading on the futures and options exchange (FUTOP) waned during the first quarter to 181,825 contracts compared to 195,516 in the first three months of 1996. But the March figure showed a year-on-year increase of 14 percent to 74,553 contracts traded, the exchange said. The most active FUTOP contract was the future on the eight percent government benchmark, with 25,672 trades, it added. --Steve Weizman, Copenhagen newsroom +45 33 969650

ECAT	The largest South African trade mission to East Africa began talks in Tanzania on Monday, stressing the region was a priority for trade and investment. "East Africa is without doubt a priority region with which we want to foster cooperation in a wide range of areas," said South African Deputy Trade and Industry Minister Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka. "This region has much to offer South African business -- whether as a market, a destination for investment and technology transfer or in the field of developing small business links." At the start of two days of talks with businessmen in Tanzania, to be followed by similar stops in Uganda and Kenya, the deputy minister pledged a package of measures to correct a large trade imbalance with East Africa in South Africa's favour. The deputy minister said South African trade with Tanzania stood at 552 million rand in 1996, down 13.65 percent from 1995, while Tanzanian exports to South Africa were worth 21 million rand, which was up 26.94 percent from the previous year. "This pattern of trade demonstrates the serious structural challenges confronted by our respective economies," he said. The mission leader said 40 South African companies chosen out of more than 200 applicants for the tour were selected on a basis of integrity and were not after "get rich quick" deals. "We strongly believe that the imbalances referred to cannot be solved merely on the basis of a narrow focus on trade," said Mlambo-Ngcuka, adding South Africa also wanted to encourage two-way trade and investments in each other's countries. Other measures included relaxing South African exchange controls to allow companies to transfer money abroad for new ventures and liberalising mandates of financial institutions. Tanzanian Water Resources Minister Pius Ng'wandu said in reply Tanzania had been at peace for more than three decades and had an unspoiled coastline of more than 800 km (500 miles) and vast unexploited areas of arable land and natural resources.

MCAT	Cheered by a dramatic recovery in U.S. stock and bond markets, the dollar rebounded from a sharp overseas slide to end a topsy-turvy session significantly higher against other major currencies on Friday. The dollar fell to lows of 1.5280 marks and 111.73 yen in European trade after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan spooked investors by warning against "irrational exuberance" in booming U.S. asset markets in a speech late Thursday. The greenback began U.S. trade near these lows, but by the end of the day, the dollar had recovered to 1.5460/70 marks, sharply higher than its opening level of 1.5305/10.   And against the yen, the dollar ended at 112.85/95, up from 112.15/25. The U.S. central bank chief's remarks sparked fears that the U.S. stock market bubble could soon burst and sent foreign stock markets reeling in sympathy. In anticipation of a similar meltdown once trading began in the U.S., the dollar slid sharply overnight. As expected, both bonds and stocks stumbled badly in early U.S. dealings, with the 30-year Treasury bond falling close to a point-and-a-half and the Dow Jones Industrials shedding over 140 points.   "Initially the dollar definitely followed the meltdown in stocks and bonds," said Doug Lee, assistant vice president and corporate dealer at Sakura Bank Ltd. "The timing of the Greenspan remarks was key because the markets had run up so high in the last week and people saw an opportunity to take profits." But weak U.S. employment data proved to be a savior for bonds, which in turn helped stocks erase a good deal of their early losses and sparked gains in the dollar.   The U.S. Labor Department reported that non-farm payrolls expanded by 118,000 in November, a far weaker advance than most Wall Street economists had anticipated. The report also showed that the unemployment rate rose to 5.4 percent in November from 5.2 percent in the prior month, allowing bonds to rebound to near flat on the day. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond closed down 2/32 at 99-27/32 to yield 6.51 percent. The Dow Jones Industrials ended the day down 55 points at around 6,382.   "The payrolls report helped to stabilize the bonds and that helped to stabilize the dollar," said Mike Malpede, senior foreign exchange analyst at Refco Group Ltd in Chicago. Elsewhere on Friday, the resignation of a British Conservative parliament member wiped out the one seat majority of Prime Minister John Major's government, hurting the British pound in late-morning trade.

CCAT	Capacity on major power lines running between the Pacific Northwest and California will increase 25 percent by February if recommendations from Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) are accepted, BPA said. BPA will meet with the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) January 10 to present its proposal, a spokeswoman for the federal power marketing agency said late Thursday. "BPA is working with the WSCC, anticipating having up to full capacity (on the intertie lines) by spring," spokeswoman Cheri Larson said. She noted that more studies of system reliability could be ordered, but BPA remains optimistic the capacity increase will be approved. Operation of the lines, known as the Pacific Intertie, was cut to 65 percent of capacity in August after two major power outages hit the West last summer. The AC (alternating current) lines have a rated capacity of 4,800 megawatts (MW), compared with current rates of 3,200 MW. The DC line is rated at 3,200 MW, but has been limited to 2,000 MW. BPA is aiming for a combined maximum of 6,500 MW on the lines by late January or February. The agency also expects to install new equipment to allow capacity to rise in stages to full rates in time for the runoff in April, when the flow of water from the melting snowpack typically hits its annual peak, Larson said.

GCAT	More than 200 opposition supporters waving banners against President Laurent Kabila defied a government ban on Friday and marched in central Kinshasa. With soldiers monitoring their movements closely, militants carrying banners saying "No to dictatorship" and "Kabila must go" set off from the central railway station in the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire. Soldiers broke up initial marches last month by firing in the air. They closely monitored the last such protest but did not intervene. Supporters of veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, who claims the post of prime minister but has been excluded from Kabila's administration, are demanding early elections. "We want a transition lasting one year until elections, and if it is going to be longer, then we want to take part in government," opposition firebrand and Tshisekedi ally Joseph Olenghankoy told Reuters on Thursday. Kabila won approval from much of the international community for a pledge to hold elections by April 1999 in the vast state where infrastructures collapsed during dictator Mobutu Sese Seko's three decades of rule. "If they refuse (our demands), that will create a climate of frustration and we may be obliged to take up arms; it seems it is the only language the international community understands," Olenghankoy said. Officials said that Kabila, who returned to the southern mining city of Lubumbashi instead of Kinshasa after his first foreign trip as head of state, would hold his weekly cabinet meeting in Lubumbashi on Friday. They did not say why. Kabila was in Zimbabwe for the Organisation of African Unity annual summit. Earlier on Friday, a gang of around 100 youths rampaged in Kinshasa, accusing Lebanese traders of engineering a drop in the value of the local currency, witnesses said. The youths, who smashed windows and threw stones, accused Lebanese traders of conspiring to force the rate of exchange to 150,000 new zaires to the dollar, from around 120,000 on Thursday. The battered new zaire currency was strengthened by the arrival in the capital last month of Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, ousting former president Mobutu. "The Lebanese were always conspiring with Mobutu and now they are trying to ruin the money," shouted one youth. Inflation was a perennial problem in Mobutu's Zaire, where successive governments printed new notes whenever they were short of cash. Kabila's government, which took power in May after a seven-month bush war, says it will follow a strict monetary policy and will at some stage introduce a new currency, the Congolese franc, although it has not yet said when. United States embassy officials said U.S. envoy Bill Richardson was expected to arrive in the capital Kinshasa on Friday for talks.
ECAT	Sri Lanka broad money supply, or M2, is seen expanding by 15 percent in 1997 against 10.8 percent last year, the Central Bank governor said on Friday. "Money growth, which is at eight percent in April, will be on target at 15 percent by the end of the year," Amarananda Jayawardena told Reuters in an interview. "That's not an uncomfortable position. Sri Lanka has had much higher money growth in the past," he said. Broad money supply rose by eight percent to 261.4 billion rupees in April this year against 241.9 billion in the same month last year.
GCAT	Hungary's largest farmers' union, MOSZ, said on Wednesday the government could more easily get around the thorny issue of agricultural subsidies in EU accession talks if it gave the union a more active role. "The government is wrong when it claims that (accession talks) are its sole responsibility," MOSZ President Tamas Nagy told journalists. "It is the responsibility of the entire society." Prime Minister Gyula Horn said earlier on Wednesday that, following the European Commission's recommendation to begin accession talks with six countries, Hungary should become a full European Union member by 2000. Talks are expected to begin early next year. MOSZ is the largest of Hungary's almost 20 farmers' unions, and its members work about half of Hungary's farmland and account for roughly half of the country's agricultural production. Nagy said MOSZ was prepared to take an active part in working out Hungary's strategy for the accession talks and take its share of responsibility. He said the government should use the union's lobbying power and that MOSZ could be an effective negotiator with agricultural associations of EU member countries. "If we can reach agreements with, say the Germans or the French, the politicians will be in a much easier position during final talks," Nagy said. Agricultural subsidies are believed to be one of the thornier issues of future accession talks with EU hopefuls. The eventual entry of 10 eastern European countries, with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia in the first wave along with Cyprus, would increase EU farmland by half and double the number of farm workers, the European Commission said on Wednesday. Severe income disparities and social distortions would occur in rural areas if the new members received the relatively high EU direct cash payments, the Commission said. Nagy said the Hungarian government should support MOSZ with up-to-date information and some form of institutional framework if it expected effective help from the union during accession talks. "So far, we have not received any such 'ammunition', as we should have," Nagy said. "We (MOSZ) are already in Brussels in several commissions and our position should be used (to the country's benefit)"
ECAT	Sales at retail stores barely edged up in March after two booming sales months at the start of the year, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Total retail sales rose last month by 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted $215.6 billion after revised increases of 1.5 percent in February and 1.7 percent in January. An unexpected drop in sales by auto dealers -- after their strongest sales gain in a year during February -- held down overall sales in March.   The March retail sales gain was weaker than anticipated by Wall Street economists who had forecast a more robust 0.6 percent pickup in business. It may raise questions about the durability of consumer demand in the second quarter though it followed two exceptionally strong sales months. The Federal Reserve cited strong demand as the primary reason for its decision on March 25 to boost short-term interest rates. Most analysts predicted further rate rises later in the year until the central bank feels demand has waned enough to keep inflation in check.   During March, auto-dealer sales fell 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $53.6 billion. That followed a 3.3 percent jump in February sales that was the strongest monthly gain since a 3.6 percent surge a year earlier in February 1996. New cars account for about one-quarter of total retail sales, so swings in demand strongly affect the overall monthly figures. Excluding cars, retail sales rose 0.5 percent last month after a 0.9 percent increase in February. Previously, Commerce said that total January retail sales had risen by 1.5 percent and that February sales were up 0.8 percent. But the government revised its estimate of the February sales rise to 1.5 percent -- nearly double its original estimate -- and boosted the January increase to 1.7 percent. That made the January sales gain the strongest in nearly a year since a matching 1.7 percent increase in February 1996.   Sales by general merchandise stores rose modestly by 0.3 percent to $27.5 billion in March after a 1.3 percent jump in February. At apparel stores, sales of clothing increased 0.6 percent after gaining 0.3 percent in February. Sales of all types of durable goods, from new cars to building hardware, rose a scant 0.1 percent in March to $89.3 billion after a 3.1 percent increase in February. Sales of non-durables like food and clothing gained 0.3 percent last month to $126.3 billion after a 0.4 percent March rise. Sales of building materials increased 1.6 percent to $11.9 billion in March after a 2.2 percent jump in February. Gasoline service station sales were down 0.8 percent in March to $13.4 billion following a 1.1 percent fall in February. Cheaper prices for imported oil after a winter surge have been reflected in lower gasoline prices, which is reflected in the sales total. -- Glenn Somerville

GCAT	Arsenal's controversial  striker Ian Wright has been handed one of the largest fines in English soccer history for misconduct on the field. The Football Association (F.A.) fined the  England international 15,000 pounds ($25,200) on Thursday for much-publicised incidents during two matches against Blackburn and Coventry last April. The incidents centred on remarks made by Wright to the referee after the Blackburn game at Arsenal and on gestures to the crowd at Coventry. Wright has been in trouble with the F.A. throughout his career. In the past the striker has been fined for spitting and making obscene gestures at fans. He has also been in trouble for verbal attacks on officials several times.
CCAT	Net profit at Credit Lyonnais Belgium SA, the Belgian banking unit of French group Credit Lyonnais, could exceed one billion Belgian francs in 1997, chief executive officer Phillipe Cloes said on Monday. He told a news conference on 1996 earnings he hoped the bank would earn net profit of more than one billion francs "if things continue as well as they do." Profit in the first quarter of 1997 was 383 million Belgian francs. A comparable number was not immediately available. The Belgian bank had 1996 net profit of 821 million francs, up from 628 million in 1995. -- Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6810, Fax +32 2 230 7710
ECAT	Japan's customs-cleared trade surplus rose 0.2 percent in November from a year earlier to 675.19 billion yen, the first time in two years it has risen on a year-on-year basis, the Ministry of Finance said on Wednesday. The surplus with the United States, often a source of trade friction, rose 31.2 percent in November from a year earlier to 378.39 billion yen. The figures were not adjusted for seasonal factors.   Japan's trade figures are released in yen. At Wednesday morning's dollar exchange rate of about 114 yen, the overall surplus was $5.92 billion, while with the United States it was $3.31 billion. Private economists had estimated an overall trade surplus of between 443 billion yen ($3.88 billion) and 590 billion yen ($5.17 billion) against a 673.6 billion yen ($5.90 billion) surplus a year earlier and a 470.86 billion yen ($4.13 billion) surplus in October. The economists said car exports, especially to the United States, were rising due to the increased competitiveness of Japanese products abroad following a weakening of the yen. A fall in the yen makes Japanese products cheaper in terms of foreign currency. But imports, particularly of communications equipment and semiconductor products, remained brisk, they said.
GCAT	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan flew in to Moscow on Wednesday for a four-day visit expressing hope that the deal agreed between Russia and NATO would reduce tension in Europe. Annan, who is on a world tour, will meet President Boris Yeltsin on Saturday. His talks with Russian officials will touch on U.N. peacekeeping operations in Tajikistan and Georgia as well as a wide range of other topics, U.N. officials said. Asked by reporters what he made of Wednesday's accord laying down a new relationship between Russia and NATO, Annan noted that he did not know the details but hoped that it would allow the expansion of membership of the western defence pact to east European states to go ahead without tension.
GCAT	A team of international observers found no major irregularities in Bosnia's first post-war elections, its director said in a preliminary report on Monday. The generally upbeat review by chief observer Ed van Thijn made it likely the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe would certify the election outcome in spite of many fraud allegations by parties and voters. But he said the OSCE should not validate the vote without a formal commitment from the dominant Serb nationalist party to drop separatism from its charter and endorse a unified Bosnia. Under the Dayton peace treaty, the elections must lead to the creation of a collective Serb-Moslem-Croat presidency and parliament to reintegrate breakaway domains carved out in war. Van Thijn also urged the OSCE not to stage municipal elections in November as planned unless problems with rigged voter lists are rectified and freer movement is established across Bosnia's internal ethnic boundaries. Van Thijn, the Coordinator for International Monitoring in Saturday's elections, said his 850 observers covered 65 percent of 4,440 polling stations in 87 of 109 municipalities. He stressed at a news briefing that his report was preliminary and should be "treated with caution". "(But), in our opinion, the elections were technically well prepared and carried out successfully under difficult circumstances," he said, alluding to the virulent hostility between Serb, Moslem and Croat communities. "There were no major irregularities, no major incidents." Voting at 97 percent of polling stations observed was conducted properly, and NATO, U.N. and local police security measures were good at 96 percent, he told a news conference. Monitors reported three notable problems with the conduct of the September 14 elections: -- Names missing or improperly registered at 56 percent of polling stations, possibly caused in part by Serb officials packing voter lists in former Moslem-majority towns with Serb refugees and other outsiders, to ratify wartime expulsions. -- Polling stations unable to handle big crowds of voters. -- Refugees unable to safely reach balloting centres in Serb-controlled areas from which they were evicted in war, except along 19 routes guarded by NATO peacekeepers. Only 14,700 of a possible 150,000 refugees actually crossed communal lines to vote, as many feared being assaulted, which van Thijn called "very very disappointing and unacceptable". Legitimate municipal elections, crucial for any return of refugees to their homes, could not be held under such conditions, the former Dutch interior minister said. Van Thijn said "thousands" among Bosnia's 2.9 million eligible voters -- almost a million of them refugees abroad -- were effectively disenfranchised because their names apparently did not show up on municipality lists. "Circumstantial irregularities, such as intimidation of voters and (illegal campaigning), were found at a few stations. "Procedural irregularities were found at considerably more." Observers noticed some people voting outside secure booths and some people, including families, voting together. But he said most polling station committees, appointed by ruling nationalist parties, were competent and impartial. Van Thijn criticised separatist campaigning by Serb and Croat nationalists, saying it highlighted tendencies towards disintegration in Bosnia which must not be glossed over. "The least the OSCE should ask for is a written statement announcing that steps are under way to adapt the Serb constitution and Serb Democratic Party programme...as a condition for (certifying election results)," he said.
ECAT	The Central Bank of the Philippines, which postponed its yankee bond earlier this week, will wait for favorable market conditions to launch its $750 million issue, the country's Central Bank governor said. "We were informed by our lead underwriter that they will be updating us on market developments every two days and they will advise us on the right time to re-enter the market. We can do this quickly, they said, because we have finished all the preparatory steps," Gabriel Singson, governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines told Reuters in an interview.   The Central Bank governor of the Philippines said the planned $750 million yankee bond issue, which was to consist of a 30-year tranche and a 100-year bond and which was meant to establish benchmarks, was postponed because of the sudden and abrupt changes in the market. "We decided, after arriving at the conclusion that this is an abnormal market, it might not be the best time to establish benchmarks," Singson said.   "I think the more prudent thing is to reset and wait for the market to normalize, especially since the purpose is to establish a good benchmark and we are not in desperate need for money," he added. Singson said though that the Central Bank was very pleased with the response from investors who attended the roadshow. "I want to emphasize that we were satisfied with the response of our roadshow from the investors. They emphasized to us that it's not a question of credit but a question of spreads because of this difficult market," Singson said.   Singson also said Salomon Brothers, which is lead manager on the bond issue, told the Central Bank that it conducted a survey of investors who expressed interest in the bond and they applauded the Central Bank's decision to reset the issue. "The majority of the accounts concurred that the decision to defer was the right one and that Bangko Sentral (the Central Bank) should be commended for excercising wise judgement during a difficult market period," Singson said the Salomon survey concluded. Asked whether the Central Bank planned to borrow in other currency denominations, Singson replied: "We have no such plans because as I have said, our objective is to establish a benchmark." (( --N.A.

MCAT	UK shares were expected to open lower on Friday, with politically-sensitive utility stocks leading the decline in the wake of a landslide victory for the Labour Party in the general election. "Clearly the trend is down," said Jeremy Batstone, head of research at NatWest Stockbrokers. "But it's not looking like a blood bath." Dealers said the FTSE 100 index of leading shares would open around 50 points easier after setting a record close of 4,445 on Thursday.   Investors were also seen anxious about the U.S. April employment report and its possible influence on interest rate policy. The Dow ended 32.51 points lower on Thursday at 6,976.48. City bookmaker IG Index was quoting a spread of 4,405-13 for the FTSE's Friday close. The resounding victory for Labour came as a shock to financial markets. The projected final tally of seats according to the BBC was 419 to Labour compared with 166 to the Conservatives.   "The result was very different from the expected 30-100 seats (majority)," one dealer said. In sparse overnight trading, utilities stocks were marked down around two to three percent as investors began to fret over the size of the promised windfall tax. Financials were also weak. "Undoubtedly a large majority is going to cause people to think twice about the market. It's no great surprise but people will start to think carefully about things like utilities," said Andy Hartwill, UK equity strategist at SocGen.   Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at Yamaichi commented that "overseas holders may see opportunities to invest elsewhere in Europe." Chancellor of the Exchequer-in-waiting Gordon Brown was expecting to honour the monthly monetary meeting scheduled for May 7 which analysts predict will result in a 1/4 point rise in UK interest rates. Gordon Brown said early Friday that he will stick to the Conservatives inflation target of 2.5 percent. The new government will hold its first budget within two months.   Gilts sagged under the weight of profit-taking but dealers expected losses to be capped. Sterling advanced versus the mark. But with two months to wait for the first Labour budget and further details of corporate taxation plans, attention was likely to turn to events in the U.S and key economic data. "If the non-farm payrolls is higher than expected it will raise fears of a U.S. rate hike and that could be the double hit that does quite a bit of damage," Batstone said. "Whether we end up or down on the day may depend on the U.S. data more than anything else," agreed NatWest Securities strategist Bob Semple. -- Elaine Hardcastle, London Newsroom +44 171 542 4027

MCAT	The Mexican peso closed slightly weaker on Wednesday after a changeable session on dealers covering positions, traders said. "The peso firmed up too much this morning and dealers were left short (on dollars),"     The benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour stablemate closed 0.4 and 0.3 of a centavo weaker, respectively, at 7.8030/7.8080 and 7.8000/7.8040 per dollar. Same-day peso contracts earlier closed 0.8 of a centavo weaker at 7.8000/7.8040 per dollar.   The peso had opened stronger in an initial bout of enthusiasm on news that Mexico will repay the U.S. Treasury $3.5 billion outstanding on an emergency loan granted in February 1995. "We saw the exchange rate see-saw a little today, albeit within a narrow range. The prepayment was another news item that sets the stage for a strong peso, but it has no fixed tendency yet," a dealer said. Traders said late weakness could have been more extensive were it not for the prepayment news and record gains on the bourse, due to a greater-then-expected fall in primary interest rates on Tuesday night. The leading IPC index of Mexican stocks was up 2.02 percent to 3,74.72 points when the foreign exchange market closed.

CCAT	Apple South Inc said it has set a goal of a 33 percent compound annual growth rate in earnings per share, a 20 percent return on equity, and a 1O percent net margin. "We're targeting a 33 percent compound annual growth rate in earnings per share and a 20 percent return on equity. And, finally, we're striving to achieve a 1O percent net margin," chairman and chief executive officer Tom E. DuPree Jr said.   The company said its long-term growth targets also include maintaining a 25 percent compound annual growth rate in the number of restaurants and a 30 percent return on investment in new restaurants. Earlier the company reported a first quarter profit of $0.19 a share compared with a loss of $0.14 a share. The 1996 period included a charge of $0.32 a share. The company said on Tuesday that capital expenditures in 1997 are expected to be $150 million.   About half of that figure is to be financed by internally generated funds and the rest through existing credit facilities. Its revolving credit facilities now total $190 million, the company said. The spending will be used to open 71 new restaurants in 1997, the company said. Apple South operates 354 restaurants.
GCAT	Russia's Ilya Itin won the Leeds International Piano Competition on Saturday, defeating five others who won through to the final round of what is considered one of the world's top musical tests. Itin was voted winner by the 15-strong panel and also won the most votes from viewers and listeners who followed the competition on radio and television and called a special telephone hotline, a BBC spokesman said. The Russian topped the field ahead of Italy's Roberto Cominati after an evening in which the leading contenders performed a concerto with the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. A total of 260 pianists entered the gruelling contest, inspired by piano teacher Fanny Waterman who decided more than 30 years ago to try to hold an international piano competition in Leeds, northern England.
GCAT	A Beirut court of apppeal will retry a former member of parliament who was sentenced last June to seven years in jail with hard labour for drugs dealing, judicial sources said on Tuesday. They said the court of cassation had decided to retry Yahya Shamas on the same charges after his lawyer appealed against the June 12 jail sentence by a lower court, which also ordered the confiscation of his assets. The date of the court session has not been set yet, the sources added. Shamas, who represented in the previous parliament a constituency in Lebanon's Eastern Bekaa Valley where the drugs trade flourished during the 1975-90 civil war, was arrested in November 1994 after his immunity was lifted by the assembly. His first trial began in October 1995. Shamas told parliament then that his troubles began after a row with Syria's top army intelligence official in Lebanon, Brigadier Ghazi Kanaan, over a real estate deal with a Syrian businessman. Kanaan is the most powerful Syrian official in Lebanon where Damascus maintains 35,000 troops and plays an influential political and military role.
CCAT	Taiwan's government on Monday appealed to the public to eat more garlic and published garlic cooking tips, trying to combat a near-collapse in prices. "We simply planted too much garlic this year," Council of Agriculture official Ku Te-yeh told Reuters by telephone. Ku said the cabinet agency was sponsoring publication of a booklet of garlic recipes and cooking tips in hopes of boosting consumption, but acknowledged that the public could not be expected to swallow the entire problem. "Garlic is a seasoning. We cannot ask people to eat nothing but a dish of garlic for dinner," Ku said. Taiwan garlic prices have plunged below T$5 per kg (eight U.S. cents a pound) from a high of T$130 per kg (US$2.14 a pound) a year ago as farmers, eager to cash in on the high price, planted far more than the market could absorb. Ku said over 60,000 tonnes of garlic had been harvested in 1996, far above the island's average annual consumption of about 36,000 tonnes, which includes industrial uses. Prices were further depressed by garlic's short shelf life, with distributors slashing prices for fear of the crop rotting in storage. "Taiwan's garlic is harvested around April to May and can be stored for up to six months. November is pushing it," Ku said.

GCAT	Prepared for Reuters by The Broadcast Monitoring Company -- EU THREATENS BA ALLIANCE PLAN The United Kingdom and the European Commission are set on a collision course over the proposed alliance between British Airways and American Airlines. The Commission has threatened to take Britain to the European Court of Justice if it approves the deal, which has been criticised as anti-competitive by airline rivals. The dispute is based on differing opinions on the likely impact of the deal on competition, though a legal case would also raise questions about jurisdiction over competition issues. -- FORD TO SPELL OUT PLANS FOR HALEWOOD FACTORY Union leaders at Ford's Halewood plant at Merseyside are due to meet management on Thursday to discuss the future of the plant. The meeting follows speculation that Ford could close the plant as part of an effort to stem losses in the company's European operations, which totalled 279.2 million stg in the third quarter of last year. Ford has said the situation had not yet reached "make or break", but it is expected the company may redefine Halewood's role away from volume car production. -- AIRBUS INDUSTRIE SET FOR COMPANY STATUS BY 1999 Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft manufacturing consortium of four companies, could be turned into a limited company by 1999 following the signing on Monday of a memorandum of understanding. Airbus comprises France's Aerospatiale (37.9 percent), Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace (37.5 percent), British Aerospace (20 percent) and Casa of Spain (4.2 percent). The group is the second biggest civil aircraft manufacturer in the world, but company status is thought necessary in order to compete with the market leader, Boeing of the U.S. -- SHELL TO CONSIDER 11 DISPOSAL OPTIONS FOR BRENT SPAR Anglo-Dutch oil group Shell is considering 11 options for the disposal of Brent Spar, the obsolete storage installation which was the subject of European environmental protests when Shell tried to dump it at sea in 1995.

MCAT	Heavy speculative dollar demand out of London drove the rand to an all-time low against the dollar on Friday and pushed forward rates sharply higher. The rand tumbled to a record low 4.6150 bid against the dollar earlier, smashing its previous record of 4.5900 set on August 19. On the forward market, 12-month rates jumped 200 points to between 4,820 and 4,920, indicating an exchange rate for the rand of 5.09 to the dollar in a year. Dealers said the move, which appeared to have little fundamental basis, was triggered late on Thursday when London traders began buying dollars and was aggravated by down beat comments from Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals on Friday. "We have seen one or two particular guys out of London, and one of them did an extremely large forward today. And our feeling is that (it) is speculative," one trader said, adding that the Reserve Bank appeared to be aware of the move. Reserve Bank officials were not available for comment. The size of the order was believed to be in the region of $200 to $300 million dollars, dealers said. "A few of the London banks who have been buying the spot dollars are actually covering forward as well," another trader said. "Last night, about $150 million was done and there was another $150 million this morning." Stals said at a conference earlier that the central bank might need to tighten monetary policy if there was no sign of a slowdown in bank credit extension and money supply growth. Stals said later, however, that he saw no immediate need to increase interest rates at this stage. "The market is starting to discount a rate hike (in the future)," said Braam Verhage, chief forward trader at First National Bank. "The forwards are going up on the back of the comments by Stals that if the money supply figures are not good he will push up interest rates," another trader said. Latest money supply data will be released at 1500 GMT. Dealers said the central bank had intervened aggressively in the market. "The Reserve Bank has been supplying quite a few dollars. I would think we have probably seen him (the central bank) feed between $300 and $500 million into the market today," a trader said. Dealers were loathe to predict the currency's next move with forecasts ranging from resistance at 4.6320 to around 4.66 Technical analysts said the currency was in unchartered territory. "Technically, we are in no man's land...it could go anywhere," said one analyst. He said that as the market had no historical chart points to refer to, he was looking to Fibonacci numbers as a guide. Fibonacci numbers are used to determine price objectives from percentage retracements. "The Fibonacci number is at 4.6320," he said. "Whether the Reserve Bank is going to allow it to go that far, I don't know." Boyde Stafne, analyst at UAL Merchant Bank, noted that the financial rand, abolished in March last year, had visited the 4.60 area, hitting 4.6587 against the dollar on August 1, 1994. "Because a lot of this is really investment related rather than simple trade related, the rand can go where the finrand used to be," he said. -- Johannesburg newsroom, +27 11 482-1003
ECAT	Cincinnati City Council members have failed to adopt a ticket tax increase to finance $100 million of bonds for the city's public schools, a council aide said. A majority of council members had been expected to support increasing the tax from 3 percent to 4 percent Wednesday, but several hours of debate failed to resolve the issue, said Jeff Eichhorn, aide to Councilman Phil Heimlich. Heimlich had proposed increasing the tax from 1998 to 2006 to satisfy the city's pledge of providing $5 million annually over 20 years to school capital needs in exchange for building stadiums for the Cincinnati Bengals football team and Cincinnati Reds baseball team. Three council members supported a second proposal to raise the ticket tax from 3 percent to 5 percent, while the remaining two supported using general funds to pay the schools, Eichhorn said. A coalition of entertainment groups opposed a large increase in the ticket tax, but did not oppose Heimlich's compromise plan. The Bengals stadium is scheduled to open before the 2000 football season while planning for the Cincinnati Reds ballpark continues. ((--David Bailey, Chicago Newsroom, 312-408-8647))
MCAT	Dollar/yen option implied volatilities tumbled from Wednesday's peaks, even though spot spiked up to fresh highs earlier in the day, dealers said. While nervousness ahead of this weekend's Group of Seven (G7) meeting and Friday's January U.S. employment report kept the very short-dated volatilities bid on dips, maturities of one-month and out were starting to consolidate, they said. "As the curve settles down and flattens, it tells you that the market is a little more comfortable with what's going on at these levels," said Alan Revercomb, options strategist at I.D.E.A. Inc.   One-month dollar/yen implied volatility stood at 12.7/12.9 percent in early afternoon U.S. trade, nearly a full point off Wednesday's lofty levels. Earlier in the day, dollar climbed to a fresh four-year high of 124.00 yen. Traders noted that although the G7 was unlikely to come out with any major initiatives to reverse the dollar's uptrend, there was a growing market consensus that the speed of the dollar's climb would be slower after next week. "The speed just can't be sustained, although the trend is still up," a U.S. bank trader in New York said.   Thus, the inverted structure of the yen volatility curve was coming under pressure. "It's coming from both ends," Revercomb said. "It's coming from the slight easing in the front end and...we've seen buying further out the curve." Six-month and one-year dollar/yen volatilities stood at 11.9/12.1 percent. They were off a quarter point on the day, but the decline was significantly smaller than at the front end. Dealers have been reporting good demand on dips for those longer-dated options this week.   Apart from a likely slowdown in the dollar's ascent and a flattening pressure on the curve, front-end dollar/yen volatilities were also weighed down by their inflated spread against dollar/mark volatilities. One-month dollar/mark volatility stood at 10.4/10.7 percent, just below late Wednesday levels. "There is a limitation (to the spread width), given that the actual volatilities of the two aren't all that far apart," Revercomb said. Still, he warned that it tended to take time for a market to calm down once volatility had been ignited.   "The floor has been moved up quite a few notches since the start of the year, and whatever the shape the curve takes, it's going to be around these higher levels," he said. "Even if you bought at the spike yesterday, it's not incredibly painful." The U.S. bank trader said risk/reversals, which reflect pricing differential for out-of-the-money puts and calls, were coming in, particularly at the front end due to the prospect of a slower dollar rise. One-month 25-delta risk reversal stood at 0.6/0.9 percent in favor of yen puts, against about 1.0 percent on Wednesday. ((Chicago Derivatives Desk 312-408-8750)) ((E-mail: derivatives@reuters.com))
GCAT	These are the leading stories in the Mozambican press on Wednesday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. - - - - NOTICIAS - Mozambique's parliament on Tuesday began debating a bill which proposes that land rights can be acquired not only by individuals and companies but also by "local communities". The bill states that land rights can be recognised, not only through bureaucratic documents such as title deeds, but also through testimony from members of these communities. - Mozambique's main parliamentary oppostion party, Renamo, says it wants army recruitment to be carried out by a 12-member committee, six chosen by Renamo and six by the majority Frelimo party. Frelimo and the small Democratic Union parliamentary coalition oppose this on the grounds that it brings party politics into army recruitment.
MCAT	Regional rubber prices in Southeast Asia face another gloomy week because of soft demand and ample stocks in major consumers like Japan, traders said on Monday. "Demand is soft all around, especially for latex which is hardly moving," a Malaysian trader told Reuters. "The market is not so rosy at the moment. We're still really in the doldrums," a dealer with a Western rubber trading company in Singapore said.   An active round of shortcovering over the past two months appears to be at an end, traders said. "Usually, demand begins to slow down after every October but this year, it's a bit unusual as buyers began covering much earlier," a Malaysian dealer said. Another trader said rains early this month which reduced tapping and supply of raw materials failed to lift prices. "If the weather begins to improve, prices are going to head south," another Singapore-based rubber trader said. Drum latex was being offered by trading houses at Malaysian 233-234 cents a kg last week.   The Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board quoted the benchmark RSS1 at 310 cents a kg while the SMR20 was at 306.50 cents a kg, both for November buyer, last week. Thai rubber prices eased last week despite some buying by China, largely due to increased supplies, trade sources said. Traders estimated Chinese buyers could have bought between 10,000-20,000 tonnes of smoked sheet rubber last week for prompt shipment. "That was not a big order. Besides, Japanese buyers are still sidelined,' one trader said.   The Thai benchmark RSS3 for November shipment was quoted at around US$1.19-$1.23 a kg FOB Bangkok against the previous week's $1.23-$1.25 a kg. One trader said the C&F price to China may be around $1.30 a kg and the FOB price to Japan at around $1.21-$1.22 a kg. Thai latex was quoted at U.S. 95 cents a kg in the auction market in Hat Yai, barely changed from 93-95 cents last week. Traders said the volume of rubber entering the market last week increased, pressuring prices.   Auction market sources said 371,392 kg of rubber sheets entered the market this week, up about five percent from the previous week. About 294,160 kg of the total were traded, the sources said. The only exception to the depressed picture is Indonesia, where the benchmark SIR20 rubber price will likely trend steady this week on the back of expected firm demand and attractive prices, dealers said. "Prices are likely to trend steady, as demand is seen firm. Any possible rises, however, are likely to be limited due to adequate supply in the market," one Jakarta-based dealer said.   U.S. buying of SIR20 January deliveries at U.S. 55.25 cents/lb fob Palembang late on Thursday against the previous 54.75 had sharply boosted sentiment, dealers said. They said, however, most of the deals were likely to remain for November/December deliveries, with offtakes in small quantity. Dealers said SIR20 offer prices for November/December deliveries were likely to rise 0.25-0.50 cents/lb to 55.50-56.25 cents/lb fob Medan and to 54.75-55.50 cents fob Palembang, Surabaya and Padang, and at 54.50-55.00 cents fob Jambi and Pontianak.   Latex prices in the local markets of Bandung and Tangerang were, however, likely to stay weak despite expected lower supply due to poor demand, dealers said. One Bandung-based latex dealer said October deliveries high amoniac grade latex was last sold at 2,200 rupiah/kg against 2,230 for September deliveries in the local markets.

ECAT	Douglas Warner, president and chairman of J.P. Morgan & Co Inc, said on Monday his company was positive about Indonesia's economic prospects and would consider setting up a securities firm in the archipelago. "We are positive. The growth rate has been consistently very good indeed. And while there will be periods of cyclical weakness, and arguably throughout South Asia this is one of those periods, we remain very constructive over the medium term," he told reporters after meeting President Suharto. Warner said J.P. Morgan would consider setting up a securities company in Indonesia but added that there were no immediate plans. "We have no plans at the moment but we are certainly going to look at it," he said. Warner said he thanked Suharto for the appointment of J.P. Morgan as adviser to the privatisation of the country's largest state-owned bank, PT Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI). BNI has offered 25 percent of its shares to the public ahead of its listing on the Jakarta and Surabaya exchanges on November 25.

CCAT	Denmark's Lego group, maker of colourful children's plastic building bricks, on Monday posted slightly higher profits in 1996 but expressed high hopes for 1997 from new products launched to combat stiff competition from computer games. Pre-tax profit in 1996 was 699 million crowns ($106 million), compared to the previous year's 676 million crowns, with net profit nine percent up at 470 million crowns on 10 percent higher 7.5 billion crown turnover. "Among the reasons for the low rate of increase are the increased investment in product development - including software - and the costs incurred as a result of the restructuring process," Lego A/S chief executive Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen said in a statement. "Earnings are not satisfactory in terms of our long term objective, which is to self-finance all the operational and investment activities we believe to be right and necessary." Kristiansen said that Lego's main activity would continue to be bricks and construction toys and dismissed media rumours that it planned to abandon bricks for digital products. "The world's children and their parents and grandparents are not tired of building and designing with Lego bricks. Far from it," Kristiansen said. "Our main business area - construction toys - will continue... not simply as today but with new ideas and inspiring play themes and more technology," he said. Lego said more new products were being launched in 1997 than ever before with over 40 percent of the product range renewed and great expectations pinned to a new Lego Scala flexible doll's house system and a Lego CD-ROM Technic set. It said sales growth in North America, Britain , Benelux and Russia helped bolster profits, with the United States, Canada and Mexico together noting a healthy 26 percent rise in turnover, while overseas markets in South Korea and Japan stagnated. Lego said investments in operating equipment and buildings in 1996 were considerably higher than in the previous year at just below 1.5 billion crowns last year, a significant reason being the opening of the new Legoland park at Windsor, west London. It said sales in Italy, Germany, Switzerland,  France and Sweden had been disappointing, while sales in eastern Europe excluding Hungary were up almost 40 percent. The only European company among the world's top 10 toymakers, Lego employs 9,450 staff in 50 companies in 30 countries. It has factories in Denmark, Switzerland, the United States, South Korea and Brazil with well over 90 percent of sales abroad. Founded in 1932 by the Kirk Kristiansen family, which still controlsd it via holding companies in Switzerland, Lego is not listed on the stock exchange. ($ = 6.593 Danish Crowns)

CCAT	China named on Thursday four more foreign banks approved to handle local currency business, and bankers said they saw the accelerated timetable reflecting a desire to boost property prices in Shanghai's Pudong zone. The China Daily said the four new banks were U.K.-based Standard Chartered Bank, Japan's Sanwa Bank and Daiichi Kangyo Bank and the Shanghai-Paris International Bank, a joint venture between France's Banque National de Paris and the Industrial and Commerical Bank of China. The newspaper said the banks, and four others named earlier, would be able to take deposits and make loans in yuan, the Chinese currency, only after they had moved operations to the Pudong district of Shanghai. "I see the whole thing as being real-estate driven," said a foreign banker. "To make Pudong a success, they need to get the foreigners over there, so there's no reason limiting the numbers." The Chinese authorities want to make the Pudong development zone in eastern Shanghai the country's premier financial district, and have told foreign banks they will only be allowed to do local currency business from offices there. "Before the banks were approved no one would touch Pudong, but now people are charging over there to try and sign something up," said a real estate broker. Foreign bankers had originally assumed the authorities would wait until the first four banks had begun operations before approving any more. The first four are Citicorp's Citibank unit, HSBC Corp's Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp unit, the Industrial Bank of Japan and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd Chinese banking sources said a number of other banks would also be approved for yuan business during 1997. Foreign bankers said the faster they were allowed into the yuan business the better, regardless of the limitations placed upon them. Approved banks can only accept Chinese yuan deposits from foreign-funded firms or from foreign individuals, or deposits from Chinese enterprises derived from the banks' loans to them. The banks can supply yuan loans only to foreign-funded firms or Chinese enterprises who have previously obtained foreign currency loans from the banks. "We won't be able to increase our customer base, but it's at least a start, another step forward," said a foreign banker. "It's a very significant step," said a senior banker with one of the chosen banks. "If a bank can't do business in the local currency then it's only half a bank." "We welcome this good news," said Lance Browne, Standard Chartered's chief executive for China. "It's a positive development for our business in China." Another banker said specific regulations for the business had not yet been issued by the central bank, and training sessions for foreign bank staff were in progress nearly every weekend. One banker said he did not expect yuan loans and deposits to begin for another three or four months, to allow all the various issues to be sorted out.
GCAT	World number two Michael Chang fought off Greg Rusedski of Britain 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 on Saturday to set up an All-American final in the men's Singapore Open. Chang will meet qualifier Jonathan Stark, who fired 21 aces to beat Thomas Johansson of Sweden 3-6 6-2 6-4 in the other semifinal. Chang was down three break points on his serve and fell 1-4 behind in the first-set tie-breaker but battled back each time. The American finally won the set when he hit a cross-court passing shot after Rusedski failed to put away an overhead smash. "I was fortunate to get out of that service game and sneak off with the tie-breaker," Chang said. "A few key points just happened to go my way." "It was just a bit of luck back there. Michael played some good points," Rusedski said. Chang stormed to a 5-1 lead in the second set and held on for victory. In the other match, Stark registered a critical break in the third game of the third set and then held serve to earn a final berth. It will be Stark's first appearance in the final of an ATP tour event since 1993. "I'm serving really well. That's the most important part of my game. Things have been falling my way," Stark said. "I'm very happy with the way I've played all week."

GCAT	Fiorentina ensured Italian clubs remained in all three European club soccer competitions on Thursday, beating Benfica 2-1 on aggregate after losing a Cup Winners' Cup quarter-final second leg 1-0. Juventus and Inter won through to the European and UEFA Cup semifinals respectively earlier in the week. The Portuguese visitors, taking advantage of complete silence at the Fiorentina end of the Comunale Stadium due to a protest by diehard supporters, took the lead in the 22nd minute when Edgar banged in a cross from Paulao on the right. Fiorentina, who scored two vital away goals in Lisbon, looked distinctly shaky in defence with Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta failing to break through up front. The home team -- winners of the inaugural Cup Winners' Cup in 1961 -- were unlucky not to pull level in the 44th minute however, when striker Francesco Baiano hit the post after a cross from former Benfica midfielder Rui Costa. Benfica had Belgian international goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme to thank for two excellent first-half saves from Batistuta, tipping one shot just over the bar. Benfica attacked hard at the finish but failed to find the missing goal.
CCAT	Swedish engineering group Atlas Copco told its annual general meeting on Tuesday that it did not see any improvement in European market trends.   "The European market shows no signs of improvement," said Michael Treschow, the company's chief executive who is stepping down. "Our estimate is that demand for the European construction market will remain weak. The manufacturing industry in Europe could, however, develop somewhat better during the year." Treschow added that he did not see any growth in the U.S., but that demand would remain high in both construction and manufacturing industry. The company was continuing to see good growth in Asia, Treschow said, and he wanted Atlas Copco to lift its presence in that region. "A global presence demands that we have both production and sales near the market," he said. "In addition, we should be able to supply other markets with components and products from this part of the world." Atlas Copco is due to release its first quarter report on April 28. Treschow had also told the AGM that sales rose six percent in quarter one to 6.41 billion crowns, while order intake increased eight percent to 7.22 billion crowns. -- Henrik Persson, Stocholm newsroom +46-8-700 1017
GCAT	Syrian Vice-President Abdel-Halim Khaddam was quoted on Monday as saying peace talks with Israel would last a century under the Jewish state's conditions for resuming negotiations. Syria says the Israeli government that lost to Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party in elections last May had agreed to return the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. But Netanyahu said in Washington on Friday: "We cannot be bound by conversations or by ideas or by speculations and suggestions and hypotheses. We can only honour signed agreements." "Returning to point zero in the negotiations means the talks will last for a century," he said in an interview with Kuwait's al-Rai al-Aam newspaper and Abu Dhabi television. Israeli-Syrian talks were suspended by Israel before its national election and Khaddam said it was illogical to return to the starting point each time a new government took power in Israel. "When (this) Israeli government agrees to resume the talks from the point they stopped at and accept what the (previous) government...committed itself to, then the resumption of talks will be achieved in a very short time," he added. Khaddam also criticised the United States for seeking to block an arms deal between Syria and South Africa. "The United States is working on limiting Arab ownership of means to defend themselves while it knows very well what (weapons) Israel possesses and what it supplies Israel with...Ignoring the Arabs like this does not serve anyone in the region or outside it," he added.

CCAT	Air Canada plans to impose no-show penalties on freight forwarders who persistently book but fail to claim cargo capacity on its transatlantic services. Because monetary penalties would be difficult to enforce, Air Canada plans to punish offending forwarders by withholding freight capacity. "If a forwarder abuses us significantly, we'll deny him capacity. It's as simple as that," Air Canada general manager for cargo Europe, Desmond Vertannes told Reuters in an interview. He said the carrier experiences a weekly no-show factor of 15-20 percent worth an estimated C$3 million a year on lost revenue and,"the most precious commodity an airline has is capacity and any abuse of that capacity cannot be tolerated." No-shows are a Europe-wide problem, said Vertannes, but they are particularly bad among Britain's more than 1,000 forwarding agencies. Air Canada has between 600-700 weekly freight bookings with up to 140 no-shows occurring "predominantly in mid-week", he added. With modern technology allowing freight forwarders access by phone, fax, telex and EDI, said Vertannes, "not to have the common courtesy to notify us of such no-shows is something we have to address". While no firm strategy has been worked out, he explained, "the no-show penalty is one we're now considering to protect our valuable weekend capacity where demand is highest and forwarders are consolidating shipments." Although manufacturers do sometimes experience quality control problems and have to cancel shipments, it is the freight forwarder's responsibility to alert the airline to unscheduled changes of this kind, he said. "Be honest and help us to help you," added Vertannes, "If you're not going to delivery sometime, don't keep the space and then end up using another carrier." In addition, some carriers "cover their options" by overbooking capacity and failing to release it in time for use elsewhere. "There is no question that we'll be taking steps in 1997 to inform the marketplace of our intentions," he explained. "What we have to do is create a structure that works so as to be sure we target our weekend capacity. Of course, we'll only introduce a system which benefits the exporting community of forwarders and shippers." Vertannes said he hoped a common approach to this problem could be developed with other carriers so as to free up this capacity to meet demand elsewhere. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
GCAT	Derby County's new signings from Costa Rica may not be able to play for the English club until next season because of work permit difficulties. Striker Paulo Cesar Wanchope and midfielder Mauricio Solis signed for Derby earlier this month and their agent said he expected them to be ready to play on March 22, when Derby are due to face Tottenham in the premier league. But on Friday the club said the two internationals might not be able to help in Derby's struggle to avoid relegation this season. "Their work permits will take at least five weeks even if there's no red tape (bureaucracy) which is very unlikely given that Costa Rica is such a difficult country," a spokeswoman said. "I doubt they'll be ready before the end of the season." Derby paid around 1.0 million pounds ($1.6 million) for the two players, who have signed three-year contracts. Wanchope scored a hat-trick for Costa Rica in a friendly against Cameroon last Sunday.
ECAT	Irish Finance Minister Ruairi Quinn on Wednesday announced "the biggest tax reduction package in the history of the State" in an election-year budget which reaped the harvest of sustained strong economic growth. Quinn cut the standard income tax to 26 percent from 27 percent, trimmed pay-related social insurance (PSRI), a payroll tax, by a percentage point and widened tax bands for single people. It was the first cut in standard income tax for five years and appeared to herald an early election for Prime Minister John Bruton's left-right coalition, which must call a poll by November this year, political sources said. Quinn said the generous 1997 tax cuts were the result of sound economic management which led to Gross National Product (GNP) growth of more than 14 percent since 1994. He said unemployment, Ireland's traditional economic black spot, had eased, with a 14 percent fall in joblessness and the creation of 100,000 jobs or 8.5 pct of the workforce since 1994. He said the data showed "the most dramatic economic and social development of our society since this State was established just 75 years ago. Ireland is now a national and international success story." Ireland, he said, "is becoming richer. Real wealth is being created by our continuous economic growth which has been four times higher than the European average." Quinn pledged Ireland's commitment to be one of the first members of the European Union's economic and monetary union (EMU) and said the Dublin government would ensure that it met the Maastricht qualifying criteria. He said the underlying general government deficit would be around 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1988 and 0.9 percent in 1999. Quinn set the Exchequer borrowing target in 1997 at 637 million punts ($1.03 billion) against a 1996 outturn of 437 million. Economists' forecasts varied from 585 to 755 million. Quinn said the 1996 current budget was in surplus by 292 million pounds against an expected deficit of 82 million punts thanks to healthy tax revenue and strong growth. But Quinn acknowledged that inflation, currently averaging 1.6 percent annually, would rise next year to just over 2.0 percent, still within the Maastricht limits. Ireland's independent central bank is reported to be concerned that the tax handouts might fuel a consumer spending boom which would fuel inflation and tarnish the country's Ireland's Maastricht credentials.

MCAT	The U.S. long bond inched lower in London on Tuesday but the short end of the curve was resilient as the market sized up the chances of further gyrations when Wall Street comes in, dealers said. "This week's a big week," said Graham McDevitt, head of bond research at Paribas Capital Markets in London. "NAPM and nonfarm payrolls will pretty much set the tone for the economy for the next few weeks." McDevitt said the key was the short end, where yields have risen some 60 basis points over the past several weeks but now have a bid tone amid a flight down the curve. "With stocks the way they are it's going to be quite an uncertain week," said a broker at a French bank in London. U.S. equities tumbled for two consecutive sessions as the long bond yield pushed above seven percent and the market took fright at the possibility of more U.S. interest rate rises. The long bond at 1030 GMT was at 94-03,04 to yield 7.10 percent, versus 94-06 bid in Tokyo and 94-04 in New York. A trader at a Japanese bank in London added that bills were looking expensive after the short end recently rallied. Two-year paper held onto Tokyo gains, trading at 99-22,23 for a 6.42 percent yield. It finished in New York at 99-21,22 on Monday. The National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) report for March is due at 1500 GMT and is forecast to show a slight increase to 53.6 from 53.1. "Going forward if the Dow Jones takes another hit today, there should be a bit more of a bid to the short end," McDevitt said, adding that highlighted the prospect for curve steepening. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 157 points on Monday after a 140-point decline on Thursday. -- Adam Cox, International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 6784

ECAT	Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller suggested on Monday that the government's export target for 1996 be raised up to $28 billion from $25 billion. "We had targeted $25 billion from exports. Let us now raise the target to $27 to $28 billion," she told a meeting of export officials and exporters in Istanbul. "And next year the target should be $40 billion," she said. Turkey's exports stood at 21.6 billion in 1995. Turkish exports have been under pressure from high input costs and the strong currency. Ciller said the government would do "its best" to address the problems of exporters, who demanded that the government kept the depreciation of the lira in line with inflation rate. "We will follow no other course but a realistic foreign currency policy," Ciller said. She said Turkey had attempted to increase trade with its oil-rich neighbours Iran and Iraq. Turkey made a 23-year $23-billion natural gas agreement with Iran two weeks ago. It also asked the United Nations to grant it an exemption from a trade embargo on Baghdad to buy Iraqi oil through a pipeline from Kirkuk to Mediterranean. The embargo bans all nations from any trade except for humanitarian supplies to Iraq since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Ciller said the government was studying the possibility to lower power costs for producers and increase the amount of Eximbank loans. --Tulin Aygunes, Istanbul Newsroom, 90-212-275 0875
GCAT	French President Jacques Chirac, visiting Beirut on his Middle East tour, told young Lebanese on Friday to be patient with their country's imperfections and to stay at home and work hard for democracy. Facing a barrage of questions from university students about human rights, freedom of expression and Syria's military presence in Lebanon, Chirac urged the young, especially young Christians, not to emigrate. He said he was distressed by the flow of Lebanese abroad caused by their lack of confidence in the country's future. "It is up to you to develop this confidence...and you, the young, particularly the young Christians, your place is here," Chirac said. He said Lebanon's recent parliamentary elections, which raised charges of fraud and intimidation, may not have been perfect but they were better than the 1975-90 civil war. "Even if it's not perfect, there have been elections, which is a recognition of the sovereignty of the people, and that is better than gunfire," Chirac said. Criticising Christian nationalists who urged a boycott in protest at the allegedly biased election law and Syrian dominance of Lebanon's political establishment, he said boycotting elections was always wrong. "Not to vote is a form of surrender....You must live with what you have and fight with what you have. And what you have is a ballot paper," Chirac told the students. Asked about a new media law that will close dozens of Lebanese radio and television stations and give a handful of broadcasting licences to government supporters, Chirac urged young Lebanese to mobilise to fight for democratic values. "You have to make an effort. Peace, like democracy, is earned, and efforts have to be made to attain it....What is essential is that everyone mobilises to achieve perfection, which is respect for democratic values and peace," Chirac said. Chirac, a close friend of Lebanon's billionaire Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, was on his second visit to Beirut this year. His 21-hour stay was the fifth leg of a regional tour to seek a bigger European role in the Middle East peace process. Asked about an estimated 35,000 Syrian troops whose presence gives Syria a dominant say in Lebanon's affairs, Chirac said he expected them to leave when the time was right, under the terms of the 1989 Taef accord which ended Lebanon's civil war. But that included Lebanon first regaining control over a border strip occupied by Israeli troops, Chirac said. "I asked the question a few days ago of (Syrian) President (Hafez al-) Assad who confirmed to me completely that for him the Taef agreements were and will be respected in every way," Chirac told the students. "Things must be done at their own pace. Perhaps one can be impatient. They must be done at their own pace."
CCAT	Bayerische Rueckversicherung (Bavarian Re) has developed a medical and vocational advisory service aimed at improving the rehabilitation of accident victims and cutting costs. "Our service is available to help victims of accidents get back into their working life more quickly," Inge Mahlstedt, member of the management board of Bavarian Re, said. The "Re-Intra" service can be used by insurers who aim to reduce their claims payments. Bavarian Re has tested the rehabilitation programme in a one-year pilot phase and will offer the service to primary companies as from June 20. The customers will be insurers who have to pay for the rehabilitation of accident victims, Hans Georg Schleich of Bavarian Re said. On behalf of these companies, two doctors and a vocational adviser visit the patient and together develop a "plan of recovery". Later they select a suitable clinic and help to arrange re-training courses. The service costs the insurance companies an initial six thousand marks for the rehabilitation planning. When the plan is put into practice, ReIntra charges 250 marks per hour. "The cost is worth it for the insurer," Mahlstedt believes. Rehabilitation for an accident victim can cost several hundred thousand marks. Good co-ordination between medical treatment and vocational re-integration is therefore very important. Should ReIntra be successful, Bavarian Re would consider offering at least part of the service outside Germany also. Reuters Insurance News, +49 221 512 007

GCAT	A sensational debut bowling performance by 25-year-old Lance Klusener enabled South Africa to win the second test against India by 329 runs at Eden Gardens on Sunday. India, chasing an imposing target of 467 runs for victory, were bowled out for 137 runs in their second innings. Klusener, who took eight wickets for 64 runs, became the highest wicket-taker on debut for South Africa in a test match. Indian batsmen, set a daunting task of batting through three full sessions or a minimum of 90 overs to earn at least a draw, failed to rise to the occasion amid some inspired bowling and fielding by the South Africans. Mohammad Azharuddin and Rahul Dravid began the day by hitting some scintillating shots with Azharuddin cutting and driving Klusener for successive fours. But Dravid's dismissal at 88 led to the Indian collapse. Dravid, who opened the Indian innings, got clean bowled to a yorker from Brian McMillan at his personal score of 23. McMillan hastened the Indian fall by taking three catches off the bowling of Klusener at slips. Left-handed batsman Sunil Joshi was the next to go as he gave a simple catch to McMillan at slips off the bowling of Klusener. Azharuddin, who scored a breezy 52, was Klusener's next victim when he nicked out a catch to McMillan. Srinath followed in a similiar fashion. Anil Kumble and Narendra Hirwani failed to provide much resistance as the Indian batting folded up at 137, some 93 minutes after the resumption of play. Klusener will spearhead the South African bowling attack at Kanpur in the third and final test, scheduled to begin on December 8, in the absence of Allan Donald who is leaving for home following a heel injury. South African opener Gary Kirsten, with a century in each innings, pipped Klusener to the man-of-the-match award. Hansie Cronje, the victorious captain, said he was particularly pleased with the way his team batted. "It was a beautiful test match wicket and our batsmen really batted well, probably the best on the tour," he said. Indian skipper Sachin Tendulkar blamed indifferent batting and poor fielding by his team for the loss. "We are still struggling to get a good start and hopefully we will be able to do that at Kanpur where I expect to do well," he said. The final test will decide the outcome of the three-test series, which is poised evenly with both teams having won one.
GCAT	A thick band of rain spread across France from the west on Tuesday, bringing extra relief to farmers who have been increasingly nervous over grain yields after three months of near drought. National weather service Meteo France predicted strong winds and showers across most of the country in the morning with the risk of storms in hilly areas, especially in the southeast. Principal grain growing areas in the Paris basin had collected 8.6 mm of rain by 0600 GMT, Meteo France said.   "A new band of occasionally heavy rain came in from the Atlantic at the beginning of the day while a previous band is moving out to the east," the weather office said. It saw a general drop in temperatures to a maximum 9-14 degrees Celsius in the north and 11-20 degrees in the south. Grain and oilseed producing areas in the southwest could get hail and thunderstorms in the aftermath of the downpour. Independent forecaster Weather Services Corp of the United States predicted "significant rainfalls" in western European wheat growing areas this week, breaking the recent drought.   It saw further rains in western Europe on Wednesday with showers further east and drier weather towards the weekend. The rain is badly needed by grain, sugar and oilseed farmers who face irrigation restrictions in many areas after one of the driest four-month spells on recent records. But many warn they will need more of the same for several weeks to make up for a water deficit in the soil which in some cases has reached 50 percent below normal. French government experts and farmers said on Monday that a previous bout of rain at the weekend had lifted some of the concerns over this year's harvest but would do little to address longer term water problems. Some experts had been reluctant to make firm predictions of crop damage, however, after similar early drought fears last year gave way to a record grain harvest in the late summer. -- Tim Hepher, Paris newsroom +331 4221 5146

CCAT	French-Slovak joint-venture Globtel GSM a.s. on Wednesday offically launched the commercial operation of Slovakia's first Global System for Mobile (GSM) telephone system. Bruno Duthoit, Globtel's general director, said that while the firm's signal now covered Bratislava and the central city of Banska Bystrica, the number of areas covered would increase to include seven other cities on January 20. "Our network will then cover about one million people, which is roughly one-fifth of the overall population," Duthoit told a news conference. He added that Globtel's signal should cover 91 percent of Slovakia's the population by the end of this year. Globtel consists of a consortium of four Slovak state-owned energy companies, state-owned monopoly gas distributor SPP and private firm Hanco sro, which hold 51 percent, and France's Telecom Mobile International, which holds 49 percent. Ladislav Rehak, chairman of Globtel's board of directors, said the company had so far invested about one billion crowns of its own resources in building the network. The company said overall investment in building and maintaining the GSM network was expected to total six billion crowns ($200 million), of which some 3.9 billion should be spent by September this year. "We plan to cover half of the sum from our own resources, with the rest financed through a syndicated loan," Rehak said. He said Globtel had yet to complete evaluation of offers in a tender for managers of an unspecified tranche of the international syndicated loan. Last December the company said it would chose the final round of four banks by mid-January and name the lead manager by the end of January. The company's basic capital now totalled 1.9 billion crowns and would be increased to some three billion through a rights issue this March. Overall GSM penetration in Slovakia is expected to be some 11 percent by the year 2006. Globtel's only competitor on the Slovak market will be Eurotel GSM a.s., a joint-venture between state-run telecom monopoly Slovenske Telekomunikacie and U.S. telecom groups, Bell Atlantic Corp and US West Media Group Inc. -- Bratislava Newsroom, 42-7-563-3687

MCAT	Romania's central bank (BNR) said on Friday the average accepted rate for one-week funds stayed flat at 48 percent at this week's refinancing auction. The BNR's offer was undersubscribed by six commercial banks, which entered 1.53 trillion lei worth of bids at prices equal to the minimum permitted rate. On Thursday, the central bank raised its one-week funds available by 370 billion lei to 1.55 trillion. BNR officials said the move was aimed to make up for a cut in other refinancing facilities, such as structural credits, before the end of the month when banks usually need leu funds to fulfill minimum reserve targets. But traders said the money market was still flooded with leu funds amid shortages on the foreign exchange market. Prices for funds up to one-week were down near 42 percent from around 43 percent over the past few days. ($=3,332 lei) -- Mirela Eremia, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264

MCAT	The dollar soared over a pfennig in early trade on Thursday, boosted by by its safe-haven status after Germany's central bank renounced government plans to revalue its gold assets. In equities, Paris stocks bounced back as investors went bargain hunting after the bourse was hammered on Wednesday by fears that the left may be well placed in Sunday's runoff parliamentary elections. Elswhere, London made an unsteady start. Most of the excitement was in currency markets where the dollar got off to a good start because of the rift between Bonn and its Bundesbank central bank. "If you are talking about safe-haven currencies, then sterling and the dollar spring to mind," said Stuart Frost, analyst at NatWest Markets. The Bundesbank's harsh attack on the government, which aimed to revalue gold and currency reserves to give a much-needed cash injection to public finances, sent jitters through the market in the run-up to European Monetary Union. The dollar surged to 1.7055 against the mark in early transactions, compared to 1.6902 in late European trade on Wednesday. The U.S. curency was also stronger against the yen. The public row in Germany has added spice to EMU uncertainty as it follows the unexpectedly strong showing for the French Socialists in weekend elections. Market expectations are that if the Socialists are elected during the final run-off this weekend, they will push for Italy and Spain to be included among EMU's founding members -- watering down the euro from the start. "The dollar should be favoured against the deutschmark because of the French elections and because the gold-revaluation rift has given a blow to Germany's reputation," said Claudio Demolli, foreign exchange strategist at Merrill Lynch. Analysts also said the gold revaluation plan, which would help Germany cut back its deficits to make the grade for EMU, would also make it more difficult for Germany to reject countries such as Spain and Italy in the first round. Against the yen, the dollar got a boost from an unexpected fall in Japan's April industrial production, which dampened expectations of higher Japanese rates. In equity markets, Paris soared by over one percent after closing down 3.63 percent, its second big drop of the week on the enhanced prospects for the left in elections on Sunday. Dealers said the boost came from bottom-fishing after the week's sharp falls. "This is a market of excesses," one trader said. "There have been sharp changes that didn't mean very much." But dealers said that despite Thursday's rebound, many investors were remaining cautious because of the market's instability in recent sessions. The market was again influenced by election result rumours, this time by talk a poll by the Swiss newspaper La Tribune de Geneve set for release Thursday evening on the internet would show the right well placed ahead of Sunday's runoff. In London, stocks recovered after making a negative start, hit by the new uncertainty over EMU and overnight losses on the Wall Street. They were trading in the plus column by mid-morning. "The market is around its highs and when you get wobbles like these around Europe, the market's not too happy," said BZW strategist, Steve Wright. Sterling strengthened against the mark, a factor which has squeezed profits warnings out of UK industry recently and driven share prices down. "Sterling is back up at 2.79 (against the mark) and that's not going to help," said a dealer. In Frankfurt, floor trade was closed because of a public holiday. Dealings on the electronic IBIS index were mixed in thin volumes and there was little initial reaction to Bundesbank clash with Bonn. Bourse trade resumes on Friday. CURRENCIES AT 0930 GMT The dollar was quoted at 1.7050 marks and 116.40 yen compared with 1.6902 marks and 115.86 yen in late European trading on Tuesday.

GCAT	Israeli soldiers quickly stopped Palestinians from hurling stones at them during a brief confrontation in the heart of Hebron on Friday, witnesses said. No one was hurt. Troops restored order in the area near the Arab market in the 20 percent of the West Bank town which remains under Israeli rule following a handover to PLO self-rule earlier in the day.   The incident took place near where on New Year's Day an Israeli off-duty soldier opened fire on the market, wounding seven Palestinians. Each side blamed the other for the incident on Friday in the volatile town where 400 Jewish settlers live and study in the heart of 100,000 Arabs. "I saw what happened. They threw stones. I saw the policemen, the soldiers, run after them," said Geula Cohen, a hardline former member of Israel's parliament who has lived in Hebron. "This is peace." A Palestinian witness interviewed by Israel Radio accused Jewish settlers of starting the incident.

GCAT	Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said on Tuesday he was hopeful of signing a friendship treaty with Russia this week to end the quarrels that have divided the former Soviet Union's two biggest Slav republics. The chances of Russian President Boris Yeltsin clinching such a deal during a visit to Ukraine on Friday and Saturday appeared stronger after officials in Moscow and Kiev said agreements on key issues had been prepared for signing. Documents on the bitterest dispute, over the Crimean city of Sevastopol which is home to the Soviet-era Black Sea fleet, were also in the works, suggesting more substantive progress than some expected. "We must solve all existing problems on this visit," Kuchma told reporters during a summit in the Estonian capital Tallinn with leaders from the Baltic states and Poland. "If Yeltsin doesn't sign the treaty, no one will," Kuchma said. "The issues are highly complex and talks very difficult." But he added: "I have high hopes for the signing of a wide-ranging political treaty...Today I like Yeltsin more. He is less influenced by political factions now." Yeltsin's much postponed visit -- called off six times in the last two years -- is a measure of the mistrust that has dogged Moscow's relations with Kiev. Ukraine's population of 50 million and proximity to central Europe have given it more freedom than other ex-Soviet states from continued influence from Moscow. Kuchma has said Yeltsin is eager for a treaty but that he has been held back by Kremlin intrigues. Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was due in Kiev on Wednesday to finalise details of a political treaty and could sign a deal on dividing the fleet and giving the Russian navy rights to use Sevastopol, located on Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. Russian government spokesman Igor Shabdurasilov told reporters in Moscow on Tuesday he had heard, unofficially, that a solution to the deadlock over Sevastopol had been found and would be included in the documents to be signed. In Kiev, foreign ministry official Stanislav Lazebnyk also said agreements were being readied on the Black Sea fleet issue. Chernomyrdin and Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko would sign three documents, Lazebnyk said. One would set terms for basing Russian ships in Ukraine, the second would divide the fleet and the third spell out what Moscow would pay Kiev. Kuchma said "many differences remain" over Kiev's offer to lease Moscow the mainly Russian-speaking port of Sevastopol. There has been argument over the term, the price and the form of payment on a lease. Ukrainian diplomats said Kiev wants to limit the lease to 20 years at $2 to $2.5 billion a year. A day before his visit, Chernomyrdin indicated Moscow was ready to meet at least some of Kiev's terms. "We are ready to strike an agreement on leasing Sevastopol as our main naval base for 20 years and extend it further on mutually acceptable conditions," Itar-Tass news agency quoted him as saying. The two premiers would also sign economic cooperation deals. The presidents would then sign the overall friendship treaty and a statement on Sevastopol as well as other documents, he said. Moscow and Kiev have announced more than once that a deal on the fleet was ready, but each time differences resurfaced. The division of the rusting ships is fairly clear, but the main stumbling block has been where to base the Russian navy. Many Russians refuse to accept that Crimea, and especially Sevastopol, is Ukrainian at all. The peninsula was only transferred from Russia to Ukraine in 1954 by Ukrainian-raised Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
MCAT	The Mexican peso extended earlier ground recouped from the dollar at the close on Tuesday on foreign capital flowing into the local financial markets, traders said. "From mid-morning onwards, pressure on the peso eased considerably due to (dollar) liquidity," a trader said. "Some foreign dealers stepped in to sell dollars, as did some locals who were long," he added. The benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour stablemate both closed 3.7 centavos firmer at 7.9310/7.9350 and 7.9270/7.9430 per dollar, respectively.   Same-day peso contracts closed earlier 4.3 centavos firmer at 7.9390/7.9430 per dollar. Traders said foreign buyers had pushed up the IPC share index by 0.87 percent to 3,789.54 points when the foreign exchange market closed, while overnight Cetes rates were down 21.80 percent. "Foreigners have basically focused on the bourse; they must have found prices attractive," another trader said. "Although they like the money market, too." Dealers said the peso had also firmed up on stability in the U.S. bond market.   U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds were down 1/32 to yield 6.96 percent. "I feel the peso could open firmer tomorrow, although it should be borne in mind that 48-hour contracts do not fall due until Monday," a trader said, referring to the fact Mexican financial markets will be closed on Friday, March 21. Traders said this could encourage traders to buy dollars at 48 hours, using pesos that may meanwhile be invested in the money market. Dealers said they would also keep a close eye on reaction in the U.S. bond market to U.S. consumer price data due early Wednesday. ((--Alexis Quiones, Mexico City newsroom +525 728-9555))
ECAT	Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan on Thursday said he would not favor tax cuts that would add to the budget deficit. In testimony bofore the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Greenspan was asked whether he would put reducing the deficit ahead of a tax cut. "I've testified to that issue affirmatively before and I would continue it," he said. Greenspan also said that, so far, increases in wages have been matched by increases in productivity, adding that there was some evidence that productivity was on the rise.
CCAT	Latvian Shipping Company (LSC), one of the largest companies in the Baltic state and due for privatisation, said on Monday it hoped to cut its losses in 1997 to $19 million and move to a $4.5 million profit in 1998. The company, which says it is the world's 19th largest shipping firm, made a $25 million loss in 1996 and a $51 million loss the year before. "A radical change of both the structure and activity of LSC would allow the company within the next three years to get rid of losses and be profitable in 1998," the company said in a statement. The Latvian Privatisation Agency is currently in talks with 14 potential foreign investors, interested in buying a 30 to 35 percent in LSC. The changes proposed by the company's board and to be considered again by its council on January 24 are expected to improve profit and cash flow. It said if the changes were approved then 1997 cash flow would rise by $20 million and another $5 million in 1998. This would mean cash flow would increase to $9 million this year and to $14 million in 1998, the company added. LSC president Peteris Avotinsh told the newspaper Dienas Bizness on Monday that the proposed changes would include the separation of the company's service structures from its core business. It also includes reducing the number of ships sailing under the Latvian flag and reducing managerial staff. LSC also intends to sell older ships and to restructure the loss-making dry-cargo department within two years, the company president told the newspaper. -- Riga newsroom +371-721 5240

CCAT	Integ Inc said Thursday its net loss widened for the fourth quarter 1996 as a result of more expenses and a planned increase in staff. Integ reported a loss of $2.97 million for the quarter versus a loss of $1.60 million last year. It is a developmental stage company working to provide a painless, bloodless glucose monitoring product for people with diabetes, called LifeGuide. "The higher net loss in the fourth quarter resulted primarily from increased prototype expenses and planned increases in staff as we build the company infrastructure that will be needed to complete clinical trials, file our 510(k) with the Food and Drug Administration in 1997, and prepare for the commercial launch of the LifeGuide System in 1998," said Frank Solomon, president and chief executive of Integ. Integ said it is making progress on LifeGuide and expects to file for FDA clearance in late summer. ((--Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787))
ECAT	Singapore's non-oil exports should be around 5.3 percent higher in July year-on-year, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Tuesday. The 14 financial institutions polled estimated the rise in nominal terms, a figure they said had been moderated to take account of the comparatively high base of the previous year. "The base in July 1996 was quite high so we've got a higher hurdle to clear this time," said one economist. July's expected non-oil figure is 3.5 percentage points lower than June's actual level of 8.8 percent.   Non-oil exports for July were seen growing in a range from 2.0 percent to 10.5 percent, with the average pegged at 5.3 percent. Exports rose 6.4 percent in July 1996. In Singapore dollar terms, the value of exports was seen in a range of S$7.4 billion to S$7.9 billion, compared to an actual figure of S$7.3 billion in July 1996. Month-on-month, the rise in exports is seen moderating after June's 8.8 percent rise year-on-year to S$7.4 billion. However, the economists said it was possible the figures due to be announded at 0400 GMT on Wednesday would be higher.   Earlier this month, figures from the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP) had grown 7.8 percent in the second quarter of 1997, up from 4.1 percent in the first quarter. Official government expectations of GDP growth were revised upwards in August to between six and seven percent for the full year from between five and seven percent previously. Analysts said they saw a surge in manufacturing output, particularly electronics, as the main factor for cautious optimism.   Total manufacturing output rose 9.3 percent year-on-year in June, compared with a fall of 1.2 percent in the previous month. Some economists pointed to improvements in book-to-bill ratios for electronics manufacturers, rising sales of computers and increasing orders from the U.S. as positive factors. Others tempered the optimism, saying there was insufficient evidence for a sustained rise in exports. Month-to-month figures were seen still slightly volatile, they said.
CCAT	LaserMaster Technologies Inc said second-quarter revenues and earnings fell versus a year ago as gross profit, as a percent of net sales, declined to 31.9 percent from 39.1 a year earlier. Operating expenses for the quarter, ended December 29, were $8.4 million, down from $9.3 million a year ago but up from $7.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 1997. "The increase in operating expenses from the first quarter...is due primarily to seasonal changes in the company's marketing expenditures. The decrease in operating expenses from the prior year is due primarily to a lower cost structure, achieved through cost reduction programs implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996," LaserMaster said.

GCAT	The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to grant sanctuary to a young Swiss bank guard who said he had been threatened after saving Nazi-era bank records from the shredder. The Senate already approved permanent residency for Christopher Meili, his wife, Giuseppina, and their two young children. The bill now goes to President Bill Clinton for signature. Under normal immigration rules, it would take years for the family to get permission to live in the United States. Meili has said he lost his job at the Union Bank of Switzerland and received death threats since his January discovery of financial documents involving assets looted from accounts opened by European Jews while the Nazis were in power. "My family's life has been turned into a living hell," he said when he appealed for help to a U.S. Senate panel earlier this year. "He was fired for his courageous actions," said Representative Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican and chairman of the committee that oversees immigration issues. "Mr. Meili has done a great service for the world in exposing those documents." Meili, who was working in the bank to support his family while he finished school, has described himself as a "simple man" who never sought to become a hero. He said he just did what he thought was right when he stumbled across carts of Holocaust-era documents heading for the shredder at the bank. That was three weeks after Switzerland enacted a law making it illegal to destroy documents relating to a Swiss probe of its Second World War-era dealings with the Nazis and the fate of up to billions of dollars in Jewish assets. The Union Bank of Switzerland acknowledged that an employee had destroyed records in "a regrettable incident." But Chairman Robert Studer accused Meili on Swiss television of acting out of ulterior motives when he handed the papers he found to Jewish leaders in Zurich. Edgar Bronfman, president of the Seagram Co. and chairman of the World Jewish Congress, has offered Meili a job.

GCAT	Left-arm swing bowler Mike Smith was set for his England debut on Thursday but rain delayed the start of the fourth Ashes test against Australia. The toss had not taken place but the teams were named for the match at Headingley. England included Smith instead of fellow paceman  Andy Caddick, the only change from the team beaten by 268 runs in the third test at Old Trafford. Smith, who plays for Gloucestershire, is the season's leading wicket-taker with 55 wickets. Australia stuck to the side already announced, with Ricky Ponting returning for out-of-form middle order batsman Michael Bevan. The sides are level 1-1 in the six-test series. Teams: England - Michael Atherton (captain), Mark Butcher, Alec Stewart, Nasser Hussain, Graham Thorpe, John Crawley, Mark Ealham, Robert Croft, Darren Gough, Mike Smith, Dean Headley. Australia - Mark Taylor (captain), Matthew Elliott, Greg Blewett, Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Ian Healy, Shane Warne, Paul Reiffel, Jason Gillespie, Glenn McGrath. Umpires: Mervyn Kitchen (England), Cyril Mitchley (South Africa).
GCAT	Juventus and Monaco won to extend their leads at the top of their respective leagues while in England victories for Liverpool and Wimbledon kept up the pressure on leaders Arsenal. World Cup qualifying matches meant there were no matches in Spain, the Netherlands, Germany and Portugal. The English programme was pruned to just four matches. The following is a round-up of this weekend's soccer from three major European leagues in action. Italy Juventus came from 2-0 down to beat Verona and, with Inter Milan losing and second-placed Vicenza drawing 1-1 at home to Parma, the world club champions are now five points clear at the top of serie A. Juve's Alessandro Del Piero scored two goals for the second time in a week. Inter were on the wrong end of a dramatic 4-3 result in the San Siro. Roy Hodgson's side were leading Sampdoria 3-2 with five minutes to go before Marco Franceschetti grabbed an equaliser. Roberto Mancini, the most prolific striker currently playing serie A soccer and a player Inter tried to buy earlier this season, then scored the winner. Inter now lie fifth in the table, seven points behind Juventus. A Demetrio Albertini hat-trick, two of them penalties, gave AC Milan a morale-boosting 3-0 win over bottom-of-the-table Reggiana. France Brazilian striker Anderson headed a late winner for Monaco in a 1-0 victory in the Cote d'Azur derby against Cannes that puts the UEFA Cup quarter-finalists two points clear at the top. Monaco have 45 points to 43 for Paris Saint-Germain, who were held 0-0 at Nantes, as the leading pair head for a showdown in Monaco on Janaury 25. Marseille, looking to regain past glories under a new chairman, beat Auxerre 3-0 on Sunday -- their second victory over the European Cup quarter-finalists in six days. The south coast side, the only French team to have won the European Cup, also beat Auxerre 3-2 to put them out of the League Cup on Tuesday. England Robbie Fowler steered Liverpool's title challenge back on course when he scored four times in his side's 5-1 destruction of Middlesbrough. The 21-year-old Liverpool-born striker's second goal was his 100th for the club in 165 appearances -- one match less than it took former Anfield idol Ian Rush to complete his century . The victory moved Liverpool on to 34 points, a point behind leaders Arsenal, who did not play, and left them level with Wimbledon who ended Blackburn's five-match unbeaten run with a 1-0 win at Selhurst Park. Chelsea's bleak winter continued when they lost 3-0  to Sunderland.
CCAT	Asarco Inc said Thursday that its board had approved a program to buy back up to $100 million of its common stock. The company also said it expects to record an after-tax gain of about $13.4 million, or $0.31 per share, in the second quarter after completing a second private placement of Series L shares of Grupo Mexico SA de CV. Asarco said it sold 20 million Series L shares of Grupo Mexico at 24 pesos per share for gross proceeds of about $60.3 million.   Asarco said the shares were sold to institutional investors outside of the United States. It said it has now sold 43.3 million Grupo Mexico L shares for a total proceeds of $125.8 million. "Asarco has been able to take advantage of favorable market conditions and realize value for a portion of its investment in Grupo Mexico," Asarco chairman Richard Osborne said in a statement. "Proceeds from our sales of L shares now total over $125 million. Having made substantial progress in achieving this strategic goal, the board has approved a share repurchase program. We will use $100 million of the proceeds to buy back Asarco shares which we believe are significantly undervalued. The remainder of the sales proceeds will be utilized to further reduce debt." Asarco said it now has 43 million shares outstanding and that the buyback would reduce shares outstanding by about 8 percent, based on the current stock price. Asarco shares closed Thursday up 1-1/16 at 30-1/4. After the sale of Grupo Mexico L shares, Asarco said, it still owns 60.9 million L shares representing 8.8 percent of Grupo Mexico's shares outstanding.
MCAT	CME lean hog futures were sharply lower at midsession and the three lead pork belly contracts were down the 3.00-cent-per-lb limit, analysts said. Hog traders said lower cash hog prices in the Midwest Wednesday drew bearish reactions from traders who as of late Tuesday, had expected steady cash prices. "The news was worse than expected," said a hog trader. "The market wasn't expecting it, that's why we are down." In addition to that bearish news was USDA's upward revision late Tuesday of last week's hog slaughter to 1.613 million head from 1.608 million. Selling in pork bellies was keyed to indications hog marketings were increasing and talk of lower cash prices. Talk circulated that cash pork bellies were bid at $85.00 per cwt and offered at $87.00 Wednesday versus $89.00 quoted late Tuesday.   Trading turned fast in hogs when chart-based sell orders were triggered near 80.50 cents per lb in the July and 78.70 in the August, traders said. At 1127 CDT, hogs were down 1.900 to up 0.050 cent with June off 1.150 at 80.050 cents per lb and July was off 1.750 cent at 80.150 cents and August was off 1.900 at 77.950. Pork bellies were off the 3.00 cent limit to down 2.350 with July down the limit at 88.900. Traders estimated about 250 July contracts were offered limit down and 300 August.

ECAT	Germany's finance ministry said on Wednesday its proposal to revalue the Bundesbank reserves would take place in several steps and that the revaluation would yield about 20 billion marks for the government. A spokesman for the finance ministry told Reuters that a very high portion of the revalution would enter the Bundesbank reserves.   "This is not a plan to activate all the Bundesbank's hidden reserves," a spokesman said, adding that the government planned to use only a portion of the central bank's reserves to reduce its debt. The spokesman said the coalition government was discussing plans through which about 20 billion marks from the reserves would be used to pay off debt in the Inherited Debt Redemption Fund. The reserves should furthermore be used to improve the central bank's capital provisions, the official added. The spokesman said that even after the planned revaluation Germany's central bank reserves would still be valued much lower than in most other European central banks. -- Bonn newsroom, 49 228 260 97160
MCAT	Activity picked up on the Latvian bourse on Monday as buyers snapped up shares in Unibanka, which fell sharply for the second straight session ahead of the state's plan to sell one million of its shares in the bank. Overall market volume was 107,000 lats compared to a paltry 44,000 lats on Friday. The Rietumu index fell 1.14 percent to 149.9 while the bourse index lost 1.33 percent to 375. "Volume today was up because Unibanka is looking cheap, and it will fall more before the state auctions its shares," said one dealer. Unibanka began its fall on Friday after the country's privatisation agency announced that it would auction one million of the state's shares in the bank on July 28 for a minimum price of 3.05 lats. While activity picked up, the market remained far from bullish, with four of the six official list stocks easing. Daugavpils Chain was unchanged at 1.10 lats in its debut on the official list while the Riga Transport Fleet rose to 1.21 lats from 1.19 lats in trade of 11,400 lats. On the secondary list, yeast maker Rigas Raugs was the most active stock in trade of 9,100 lats. It was one of the session's few gainers, rising 3.2 percent to 3.89 lats. -- Ed Stoddard, Riga newsroom +371 721 52 40

GCAT	A newspaper suggested Monday that Joan Kroc, the wealthy widow of McDonald's restaurant founder Ray Kroc, was the anonymous "angel" who pledged $15 million to help Red River flood victims. "I didn't want this to happen," Grand Forks Mayor Pat Owens said of the report that Kroc was the city's anonymous benefactor who visited the flood-damaged city over the weekend. "I didn't want this and she didn't want this." Owens and Lynn Stauss, Mayor of East Grand Forks, Minnesota, had said they met the "angel" on Saturday for a 2-1/2-hour tour. The Grand Forks Herald reported that Kroc's Gulfstream IV jet landed at the airport that afternoon and quoted airport workers as saying an older woman emerged from the jet along with eight or 10 other people. "Angel was in town Saturday night. So was Joan Kroc's jet. This appears to be no coincidence," the Herald said. There was no official confirmation that Kroc was the "angel". When the gift was first announced, officials said it had been given on condition that the donor remain anonymous. Kroc, a billionaire, is known for bestowing spontaneous gifts on hard-luck causes as well as giving money to schools and hospitals. The benefactor's $15 million pledge -- for which he or she was dubbed the "angel" -- was being doled out in $2,000 portions to households in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks damaged by devastating Red River flooding last month. But there were 11,000 applicants, more than could benefit from the gift at that rate. Another anonymous donor, an unnamed corporation, has promised $5 million to be distributed in $1,000 increments.

MCAT	Three month copper futures on the London Metal Exchange (LME) fell below the psychological $1,900-a-tonne barrier for the first time in seven weeks in late inter-office trade on Wednesday. The losses were on continued long liquidation and speculative selling partly based on bearish chart patterns, traders said.   The market has now fallen some 13 percent from the recent peak of $2,165 hit earlier this month. At 1808 GMT on Wednesday three months copper futures were last quoted at $1,880/90, off a low spread of $1,870/80. This compares with Wednesday's afternoon kerb close of $1,915. Chartists said the market was now vulnerable to further stop-loss selling towards the next big level at $1,800. But if LME stocks continued to trend lower and supplies tightened further, the downside may be limited at least in the short-term, some traders said. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 8057
MCAT	U.S. domestic crude grade values stabilized late Wednesday, trading in modest volume at slightly weaker levels established earlier in the session. October West Texas Intermediate/Cushing ended more than 60 cts higher at $24.70-$24.80, topping earlier in the day near $25.00 due to tensions between Iraq and the U.S. Concerns new U.S. airstrikes are on the horizon fueled a NYMEX futures spurt, but profit-taking ate into the advance by the close. Reports hyped the U.S. military move to bring high-tech "Stealth" bombers to the Persian Gulf, possibly to use against Iraq after U.S. planes were fired on Wednesday.   Domestic grades were mostly quiet to the close, attracting attention at the same price levels from mid-morning. Light Lousiana Sweet/St. James was sold at 33 cts and 37 cts over WTI/Cushing, ending at the weaker range between 32-34 cts over WTI. Midland/WTI was done at 10 cts over WTI/Cushing, and talked at 5-9 cts over by the close. Little attention was given to the Texas sweet grade, traders said. Heavy Louisiana Sweet/Empire changed hands at between 22-25 cts over WTI/Cushing, ending a few cents off the firmer talk at a 23-25 cts premium to the WTI. Sour grades were steady and quiet, with Eugene Island talked at minus $1.08-$1.03, and West Texas Sour/Midland  even at a discount of $1.19-$1.17 to the WTI/Cushing. Postings-Plus was traded as strong as $2.45, and talked between $2.39-$2.41 to the end of the session. Brent paper dealings were sparse as well Wednesday, with many industry heavy hitters off to conferences, traders said. The few deals done were a spread for Oct/Nov at 70 cts, and two 100 lot outright parcels for November Brent at $22.83 and $22.84 respectively. --Patrick Connole, New York Energy Desk, +1 212 859 1620
GCAT	Rebel forces of Laurent Kabila took the town of Kipushi just 30 km (20 miles) from Lubumbashi on Monday and were heading on down the road to Zaire's second city itself, residents in Kipushi said by telephone.   "There were perhaps one to two thousand of them. They were armed and in uniform and mostly young," said businessman Gilbert Mbangu, speaking by telephone from his home in Kipushi. They entered the town in the early morning, meeting no resistance, and headed on to Lubumubashi at dawn on foot, Mbanga added. In Lubumbashi, businesses with contacts in Kipushi confirmed the rebels had swept through the town taking residents completely by surprise. Shops and businesses in Lubumbashi were closed and all incoming flights were cancelled. Mbanga said the force appeared to have come from the direction of the Zambian border post near Kipushi, but it was unclear whether they had come in from Zambia itself or emerged from the bush on the Zairean side of the frontier.
GCAT	Security forces in Zaire's capital Kinshasa used teargas on Wednesday against supporters of new prime minister Etienne Tshisekedi, following the declaration of a nationwide state of emergency. Witnesses said armoured vehicles blocked access to the embattled Central African nation's prime minister's offices, where the veteran opposition leader and foe of President Mobutu Sese Seko had planned to install himself with his team. Several thousand supporters of Tshisekedi had gathered outside his residence in the western district of Limete to follow his motorcade to the prime minister's offices. The crowd, which was following Tshisekedi's motorcade, broke up in the face of the teargas. Elsewhere in town, thousands of Tshisekedi supporters stopped traffic letting only fellow militants through. Tshisekedi's motorcade left the scene but it was not immediately clear whether he had continued his journey to the prime minister's offices. Mobutu, who seized power in 1965 but has seen his hold over the sprawling country crumble as the rebels advance, announced the state of emergency via a decree read on state television late on Tuesday. He appointed military governors to Kinshasa and other areas not under rebel control. His decree did not make clear what restrictions would be imposed or the implications for Kinshasa and its more than five million people. Tshisekedi is under fire from Mobutu supporters and allies alike after less than a week in the job and announcing a government composed only of his most loyal followers. He earmaked six posts for the rebels, who took up arms in October vowing to topple Mobutu and who hold nearly half of the country, but the offer was rebuffed. Rebel leader Laurent Kabila, speaking in Mbuji-Mayi, the capital of Tshisekedi's diamond-rich home province of Kasai on Tuesday, said the new prime minister and his supporters should make a complete break with Mobutu. "The real problem with Tshisekedi is that Mobutu is always in the background, manoeuvring to divide the opposition and remain always in control," said Kabila, for whom Kasai is a key test of rebel support. Earlier in the week, Tshisekedi supporters staged protests to block efforts by his critics in parliament to unseat him. Outgoing prime minister Kengo wa Dondo and his team have said that Tshisekedi's government has not formally taken power as it has not won the blessing of the transitional parliament. Parliament voted out Kengo following persistent charges that he mismanaged the war. Kabila said on Tuesday that members of Mobutu's elite presidential guard were putting up a fight on the approaches to Zaire's southern second city Lubumbashi. The guard themselves said they had pushed back rebels there. The thud of what military experts said was heavy artillery could be heard on Wednesday in the deserted streets of Lubumbashi, coming from several km (miles) to the south, after noon local time (1000 GMT). It died away quickly. Gunfire was also heard. Expatriate and business sources in the city said contacts in the town of Likasi, 120 km (75 miles) away to the northwest on a main railway line, reported it had fallen to the rebels on Tuesday night. Zambian sources in Ndola, near the Zairean border, said the rebels also seized the town of Sakania just across the frontier and some 200 km (120 miles) from Lubumbashi on Wednesday.
ECAT	Mexico's economy grew 8.8 percent in the second quarter, its most vigorous quarterly performance since 1981, the government said Monday. Economists were particularly impressed by the strength of the service sector. Its robustness, they said, showed the recovery was deepening on the domestic side of the economy, which had fallen into recession after the crash of the Mexican currency in late 1994.   "The number was a lot stronger than expected basically due to the services sector, which showed a surprisingly strong performance," said Santander Investment economist Enrique Ramirez. The services sector, which includes hotels, retail sales, financial services, and transportation, posted a muscular 7.7 percent increase in the second quarter. "It is very positive that much of the growth was due to the domestic economy and not just to exports as before," Ramirez said.   Exports were the backbone of economic growth because the peso's crash enabled Mexican exporters to bump up sales abroad quickly. But Mexican consumers, facing a combination of higher interest rates and inflation and lower real wages, have been slower to climb out of the hole carved out by the crisis. Against that backdrop, analysts welcomed the fresh evidence that growth of gross domestic product (GDP) had broadened during the second quarter. "The GDP number was well above expectations and helps confirm that the expansion and the recovery has broadened out," said Bankers Trust economist Denis Parisien.   A Reuters survey of brokerages and economists had shown expectations of second-quarter growth closer to six percent. "It was an excellent result. The implication is very clear and that is that private consumption is stronger than many people thought," said Alonso Cervera, chief economist at Interacciones. The Finance Ministry on Monday also said first-half GDP expanded 7.0 percent from the same period a year earlier. Economists said the economy's robust performance would likely lead to an increase in growth forecasts for the year.   Cervera of Interacciones said 1997 GDP growth of more than 6.0 percent was "the most likely scenerio." Santander Investment's Ramirez said his firm, which had forecast of 5.0 percent growth for the year, might increase its estimate. He said a revised forecast of 5.7 or 5.8 percent growth was possible. Despite the improving economic outlook, most of the Mexican financial markets failed to rally after the news, with concerns about the direction of the stock market in the United States weighing on the bolsa. Some dealers said the shooting of the brother of Mexico's finance minister on Saturday had contributed to a softening of the peso. An exception was Mexican overnight Cetes rates, which eased after the release of the GDP data. Money market dealers said the stronger-than-expected data supplied further evidence of an improving economic scenerio. The industrial sector rose 11.2 percent in the second quarter, while the agriculture sector posted 10.4 percent growth, the government said. ((--Mexico City newsroom +525 728-9559))
MCAT	Indian cotton prices are expected to be mixed in the current week in subdued trade, dealers said on Thursday. They said prices of cotton varieties from the western state of Gujarat firmed on buying by governmnet agencies to appease farmers ahead of a local election in that region. "Farmers form a big vote bank and and their lobby influences the outcome in local elections," said a trader. Gujarat is a key cotton producing state in India. In the week to Thursday, Gujarat Kalyan (medium-staple) rose 400/500 rupees to 13,000/13,500 rupees per candy (355.56 kg) and Gujarat Sankar-4 (long-staple) gained 500/1,000 rupees to 19,000/20,000 rupees per candy. Punjab saw-ginned dropped 60 rupees to 1,500/1,650 rupees per maund (37.32 kg). Bengal-deshi fell 10 rupees to 870/920 rupees per maund and F-414 lost 40 rupees to 1,880/1,900 rupees per maund. Manubhai Amarsey, a leading cotton trader, said supplies from Gujarat and northern India were low and trading volumes small during the week as most players kept to the sidelines ahead of year-end closing of accounts. Fiscal 1996/97 ends on March 31. "Market sentiment is also dull on reports that the government is considering allowing more export of value added items like cotton yarn instead of raw cotton," Amarsey said. Traders had been expecting a further authorisation of at least 200,000 bales following last month's official estimate of the 1996/97 crop at 16 million bales, the same as in the previous year. The government has already authorised an export of 1.2 million bales (one bale is 170 kgs) in the current season against 1.59 million bales in 1995/96. - Bombay Commodities +91-22-265 9000
GCAT	Hyperactive Hector "Macho" Camacho acted up again at a news conference Wednesday by throwing a glass of water in the direction of Sugar Ray Leonard. "It's nothing new," Leonard said of Camacho's crude behaviour that also included him kicking a table. "Whether it was nervous energy I don't know. That's not cool." Leonard, 40, fights for the first time in six years Saturday at the Atlantic City Convention Centre when he meets Camacho in a scheduled 12-round bout. Camacho exploded when Leonard's advisor, J.D. Brown, interrupted him during his remarks. Camacho and Brown have feuded throughout the promotion for the fight. "He has no reason to open his mouth and speak for Ray," Camacho said. "If Ray ain't doing it, who is he to do it." Camacho quickly cooled down and sheepishly apologised for his behaviour. "I'm not there to be no troublemaker," said the 34-year-old Camacho. "He brings the kid out of me, I got carried away as always, it is my fault." Leonard, 36-2-1, has been a world champion in five different weight classes and a gold medal winner in the 1976 Olympics. Camacho, 63-3-1, who has also held titles in various divisions, currently holds the middleweight belt of the little known International Boxing Council.

CCAT	McCollam Printers Ltd said on Friday it expected its net profit for the year to March 31, 1997 to comfortably beat last year's NZ$3.125 million. McCollam earlier reported a rise in first half net profit to NZ$2.24 million from $2.16 million on consolidated sales of $18.7 million, up from $13.9 million. This included six months of revenues from All Mark Industries.   McCollam said the first half profit increase was despite a very flat second quarter market place and economy generally. Lower and more stable paper prices balanced by a softer market had seen a steady result in the core printing group, with a pleasing first result from All Mark taking the half year earnings, particularly at an operating level, past last year. "All Mark is now well positioned to improve both revenues and earnings and we are looking to an improved result in the second half," the company said.   "On the basis of our current results, we expect our full year profit to comfortably exceed last year's performance, subject to relatively normal market conditions prevailing." McCollam, which said last week it had agreed to buy the business assets of Format Publishers, said it expected Format to produce 1997/98 revenues of $15-16 million and earnings before interest and tax of $2.5-3 million, which would contribute strongly to the group's overall performance.   "The directors expect that the enlarged group will generate a very satisfactory level of cashflow in the subsequent financial year and will maintain a strong financial position platform from which to continue development of the business." Subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence and final shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting in January, the Format deal is expected to be completed by February 1. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 473-4746
ECAT	Federal Reserve officials are not likely to raise short-term interest rates soon unless inflation grows, the Washington Post reported Friday. The Post story was based largely on a speech Thursday by Fed Governor Lawrence Meyer. The newspaper said Fed officials were unlikely to opt for higher short-term interest rates as a precaution against renewed inflation as a result of low U.S. employment. "Unless we saw some evidence of that (low unemployment leading to higher inflation), we would not want to move," the Post quoted Fed Governor Edward Kelley as saying in a recent interview. Kelley told the Post it was not yet clear whether the changed relationship between high inflation and low unemployment is permanent or temporary. "For now, no one here is taking the view that this is a permanent change," Kelley said. Meyer in his speech struck a similar tone, saying he had a "slightly greater concern" that inflation will increase than that the economy will weaken.

CCAT	N Brown Group plc said on Wednesday it was withdrawing from negotiations with Sears to buy its Freemans home shopping business.   In a brief statement, N Brown said that after "due diligence" it "felt unable to proceed" with the purchase negotiations. British home shopping firm N Brown emerged as the favourite to buy Britain's third largest mail order company earlier this month after Littlewoods  pulled out of talks with Sears to buy Freemans. However, N Brown said on Wednesday its "original announcement indicated that the offer for Freemans would be on similar terms to those agreed between Sears and Littlewoods." In January, Littlewoods had agreed to buy Freemans in January for 395 million pounds ($630.8 million), but the acquisition was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on competition grounds. Littlewoods then withdrew when it emerged Sears was talking to other possible buyers. Sears said it could not give exclusivity to Littlewoods after it had received other offers and wanted to consider the best in the interests of shareholders. Just two weeks ago, Manchester-based N Brown said Freemans would expand its market, giving it access to a younger customer base, which would complement its own direct mail catalogues aimed at older customers. --London newsroom, +44 171 542 7717 ($ = 0.626 British Pounds)

CCAT	Thai animal feedmillers said on Monday they were worried domestic political uncertainties might affect a government plan to cut import duty on raw materials for their industry. The industry was hoping that a duty cut would be approved at the weekly cabinet meeting on Tuesday, which could be the last one outgoing Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa may attend. Banharn said on Saturday he would quit within seven days after pressure from key partners in his six-party coalition government. The commerce ministry had proposed to cut import duty to 10 percent from 15 percent for soymeal, to zero percent from five for soybean, to zero percent from three for corn and to 15 percent plus 140 baht/tonne surcharge from 6.0 percent plus 1,400 baht/tonne surcharge for fishmeal. "I'm sure the cabinet will be swamped this week but I still hope the proposal will make it," said a trader at an American trading house here. "The trend is toward a freer market. Strong restrictions (on imports) would only undermine any government's effort to maintain price stability on food prices such as poultry and meat," said a source at Bangkok Produce, a leading feed producer. Other areas that could be held up by the political changes were industry proposals for an increased import quota this year for soymeal and soybean. "It is unlikely that a decision on the issue could be made before this government leaves office," a commerce ministry official said. The industries had previously requested that the government allow an extra 200,000 of soymeal and unidentified amount soybean to be imported this year, the official said. The import quota under the government's low tariff programme this year was 830,000 tonnes for soymeal and 426,460 tonnes for soybean.
MCAT	Interest focused on the export-driven chemical and car industries lifted the German share market on Friday, but dealers were wary of labelling the move a clear change from a recent sharply downward trend. The 30-share blue chip DAX index rose 23.17 points to end the floor session at 3,238.41, holding firm despite a renewed overnight drop on Wall Street as fears of immminent rate increases continued. While dealers welcomed what they said was a return to focus on fundamentals on the German market and an initial attempt to decouple from the U.S., volumes were thin and attention still firmly focused on key U.S. payroll data due in the afternoon. "Monday is the earliest we will really be able to tell if we have found a real floor," said a Frankfurt dealer. "I think we have already priced in bad news, but these things are very hard to call," another dealer said, looking ahead to what might be a turbulent post-bourse session when Wall Street opens. "I wouldn't rule out another tough Friday." BASF AG was among the top gainers with an increase of 3.5 percent to 63.65 marks after sending out a bullish outlook for 1997 this week. But all export-driven shares accompanied the advance, with the DAX-100-share car index up 1.6 percent, the chemical sector index up 1.6 percent and the engineering index up 1.2 percent. Car and chemical shares had been expected to drive any recovery on the German share market as the mark remains broadly weak against most major currencies, improving the outlook considerably for export earnings. The dollar also posted gains on Friday. Among major car shares, Daimler Benz AG rose 1.10 marks to 123.85 marks and BMW was up fifty six marks at 1,275 marks.

MCAT	*Dollar finishes with modest gains against most leading currencies after a Reuter news report rekindled hopes for Fed rate hike at Sept 24 FOMC and U.S. Commerce Secretary Kantor said recent dollar/yen strength appears not to have hurt U.S. car sales to Japan. An auto industry spokesman disagreed. *US intl trade due Wed 0830 EDT. July trade gap seen -$8.8 bln The dollar ended firmer after a Reuter news report helped rekindled hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon hike interest rates, currency experts said. An unnamed senior Fed official told Reuters on Tuesday that eight of the Federal Reserve's 12 district banks have requested a hike in the five percent discount rate amid mounting evidence the U.S. expansion will likely remain brisk. "All the comments about the Fed this morning suggest that we're back to looking for at least a 25-basis-point hike at the next week's meeting," said Chris Iggo, an international economist at Barclays Bank Plc. "So that's giving the dollar in general a positive tone," Iggo added. The Fed's next policy setting meeting is scheduled for September 24. The official, who requested anonymity, said a consensus at the Fed is emerging in favor of a quarter point increase in the federal funds rate. The source also suggested the meeting could see a 25 basis point hike in both the discount rate and the 5.25 percent federal funds rate. The dollar rose to session highs of 1.5161 marks and 110.44 yen on Tuesday. The U.S. unit closed at 1.5139/44 marks, up from 1.5121/28 at the open. The dollar ended at 110.24/31 yen, moderately higher than 110.15/22 at the open. The Reuter story startled financial markets because mild gains reported last Friday in both the consumer price index and retail sales had diminished expectations for an imminent increase in interest rates. Remarks by U.S. Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor had also helped boost the dollar against the Japanese currency. Kantor told a news conference that the recent strength of the dollar against the yen appears not to have hurt American car sales to Japan. Kantor's comments came just one day after Ford Motor Co chairman Alexander Trotman warned that the dollar's recent rise to more than 110 yen is an increasing cause for concern to American auto makers. The Commerce Secretary's statements left some currency traders believing the White House is not going to pay too much attention to car company complaints even during an election year. "The other helpful thing was Kantor's comment," said Ben Strauss, an assistant vice president at Bank Julius Baer and Co. "It makes one think that these levels (in the dollar) are acceptable to the Administration." Nevertheless, an auto industry spokesman late on Tuesday challenged Kantor's assessment of the impact on automakers of a stronger dollar against the yen. Andrew Card, president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, told reporters that a 30 percent decline in the value of the yen over the past year has put pressure on U.S. manufacturers' ability to price their products competitively with Japanese manufacturers. Weighing the statements by Card and Kantor, some currency analysts still found the Commerce Secretary's views more influential on the foreign exchange market. "I think it's quite a telling statement that basically the Administration isn't going to be as sensitive as some people believed to the dollar above 110 yen," said Chris Turner, a currency strategist at I.D.E.A. Inc. Elsewhere, the dollar closed at 1.2437/44 Swiss francs, up from 1.2399/06 at the open. The pound closed at $1.5559/66, slightly higher than $1.5541/48. The U.S. unit also finished at Canadian $1.3707/12, barely changed from C$1.3708/13. The Australian dollar ended at $0.7888/93. -- Donna Sells 212-859-1668
GCAT	The leader of the Ulster Unionist Party on Wednesday rejected suggestions that Monday's murder of two Northern Ireland policemen by IRA gunmen may be the result of divisions between hawks and doves among republicans seeking to end British rule in the province. David Trimble said Sinn Fein and the Irish Republican Army were "part and parcel" of the same republican movement, and he saw no indications that a split was developing within its ranks. "I don't think one should allow Sinn Fein off the hook on this," Trimble said in an interview with CNN, adding his belief that Monday's attack was "clearly designed by Sinn Fein in order to provoke disorder." "Sinn Fein have been portraying themselves as a peace party, but now people see them in their real colors," Trimble told the cable network. "Peace was only a pretense." He condemned the murders and urged Irish loyalists not to be provoked into reciprocal violence. Instead, the attack should help underline the urgency of resuming political talks, as well as ensuring the security of people in the region. "The last thing anyone wants to see is to see this spiraling out of control into a series of tit-for-tat killings," Trimble said. The two policemen were shot in the head at point blank range on Monday in the town of Lurgan, south of Belfast, in an ambush which dealt a shattering blow to efforts to bring peace to Northern Ireland. Analysts said the ambush defied logic since it happened when frozen relations with Britain seemed to be thawing and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, appeared closer than for many months to being allowed into multi-party talks on the province's future. Sinn Fein, led by Gerry Adams, says all-party talks are the way to thrash out a new political settlement. That means face-to-face negotiations with representatives of the province's majority Protestants who despise republicanism and want to stay under British rule.
ECAT	Finance Minister Paul Martin said on Friday the Canadian economic recovery was well-anchored, although it was wise to be prudent with government statistics. "The economic recovery is well anchored, and we're seeing not only good export numbers but we're seeing an increase in consumer demand and an increase in employment," Martin told reporters. He added that it was important to realize that the economy had come through a rough period, especially the 1989-92 recession. Asked to comment on the increased bankruptcy numbers reported on Friday, he said: "Business bankruptcies are down, personal bankruptcies are up. "But the normal flow of these things is that the first signs of improvement begin to show in the business bankruptcies, which is what is happening, and one would hope that the personal bankruptcies will fall." He pointed to a number of studies, not just in Canada but also the United States and elsewhere, that show one reason for personal bankruptcies may be an increased use of credit cards. Asked if Canadians needed therefore to better manage their debt, he said: "This does not only apply to Canadians, but I think it applies to everybody. This is not strictly a Canadian phenomenon. Business bankruptcies in January, at 1,073, were below the year earlier figure of 1,282 but above December's 1,045. ((Reuters Ottawa Bureau 613-235-6745))

GCAT	Buoyed by a long-sought IRA truce but battered by Protestant condemnation, Britain is struggling to anchor the stormy peace process in Northern Ireland. Guerrilla guns are silent, after the Irish Republican Army renewed a ceasefire last weekend in its 28-year war against British rule of Northern Ireland. But pro-British Protestant politicians on Wednesday dealt a severe blow to faltering talks on the future of the province by rejecting a plan, framed by London and Dublin, to disarm rival guerrilla groups. Unless the two governments blink first in an angry standoff with the Protestant unionist parties, who want immediate rather than gradual guerrilla disarmament, further round-table talks will be inconclusive, political commentators said. While Britain shrugs off suggestions that the unionist stance on arms has effectively scuppered the peace talks, the process is in grave difficulties. Analysts said that if unionists refuse to attend a crucial September 15 talks session at which Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, will take its seat for the first time, the two governments might have to fashion a new system of talks. The governments say that current talks chaired by former U.S. senator George Mitchell, aimed at getting all parties round one table, are the best ever prospect of cementing peace. They are determined to stick to a timetable for full-scale talks on the province's future to start on September 15. Political analyst Paul Bew said that because the biggest unionist group, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), had shown a willingess to remain in talks, Wednesday's vote by the three unionist parties on arms "decommissioning" had not fatally wounded the peace process. However, it suggested that prospects were gloomy for  the current talks initiative. "It is not a dramatic blow against the peace process,"  said Bew, professor of politics at Queen's University Belfast. "It is a very significant sign that we could, however, be getting into extremely serious and even terminal difficulties with the Mitchell process, which by definition requires substantial unionist participation," he told Reuters. Some 3,200 people have been killed in the past three decades of conflict between Northern Ireland's 60 percent Protestant majority and its Roman Catholic minority. Republicans who want to join neighbouring Catholic Ireland are pitted against unionists who want to stay part of Britain. Three unionist parties joined forces in Wednesday's vote to torpedo an Anglo-Irish formula for persuading IRA guerrillas, and banned pro-British Loyalist militias, to hand over weapons. Two of them stormed out of the talks, but the UUP said that despite its opposition to the arms plan, it would stay in. A question mark remains, however, over whether it will go the full distance and sit at a table opposite Sinn Fein representatives, without further assurances from London about the necessity for IRA guns to be surrendered early on. Many commentators believe that UUP leader David Trimble, taking flak from unionist rivals who have left the talks process, will not be able to sit at the same table, with or without fresh assurances from the British government. Commentators say momentum could be slowed if Britain and Ireland decided to switch to bilateral talks with the factions, or hold proximity talks, in which Unionists and Sinn Fein sit in different rooms. The Irish Independent, a Dublin newspaper that takes a strong anti-IRA line, praised Trimble's courage in remaining in the talks and urged London and Dublin to make moves to help him. "They should seek, in the breathing space between now and mid-September, to find a formula on (arms) decommissioning which... will strengthen his hand vis-a-vis the extremist (unionist) elements," the paper said in a commentary. Unionists say the disarmament plans are toothless, and will enable Sinn Fein to ride into talks while IRA arms remain ready for use if the republicans do not get their way. The British and Irish governments have for three years been pursuing a joint strategy to resolve the Northern Ireland conflict.They agree that the province will remain British while a majority there supports current London links.
GCAT	Pakistani police said on Sunday a member of the police squad involved in the shootout with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's estranged brother may have been murdered. Inspector Haq Nawaz Sial was found dead on Saturday at his police residence with a bullet wound to the head. Sial was one of the police officers who took part in the shootout in which Murtaza Bhutto and his seven body guards were killed on September 20 in Karachi. Police had initially said Sial's death was suicide. They said in an overnight statement they were investigating new evidence from Sial's family and from government-appointed doctors who performed an autopsy on Saturday. "Considering this, the police investigation is currently directed at determining whether it was a case of suicide or homicide," a police statement said. A police official who asked not to be named said "the medico legal evidence suggests that though the single bullet fired was aimed at the right temporal region of the deceased inspector, it may have been fired from a distance of a couple of feet". He said the autopsy team had failed to find traces of gunpowder on Sial's hands which could have been conclusive evidence of suicide. The police statement also said Sial's wife had seen two masked men fleeing after being woken by a gunshot. Murtaza's supporters have accused police of ambushing and killing him. Police say they fired in self-defence after Murtaza's bodyguards started shooting. Two policemen, including Sial, suffered injuries. The southern Sindh province government was likely to issue a report on the findings in the doctors' autopsy report later on Sunday, police said. Doctors investigating Murtaza's killing said on Thursday the wound suffered by Sial during the shootout was "self-suffered". The police had posted two guards outside Sial's official residence soon after the team's report was made public. The Sindh government on Tuesday had set up the medical board to investigate whether or not the wounds suffered by the policemen resulted from the shootout.

CCAT	Thailand has no plans to further raise its oil reserves despite ongoing concerns about future supply security, a senior National Energy Policy Office (NEPO) said on Wednesday. Metta Banturngsuk, NEPO's Deputy Secretary General, told Reuters that Thailand had oil reserves that would last 36 days. He said although the reserves should in theory be raised, in practice any further increments would be too costly. "In some industrial countries, the reserve requirement is more than 100 percent which is good but we just can't afford that," he said. Shortage of storage space, higher costs that would be eventually be passed to consumers and consequently any impact on inflation must be taken into consideration,  he said. "We are concerned about supply security but we just cannot think in terms of raising resrves alone to ensure security," he said without elaborating. Thailand currently requires local refiners to reserve five 0 percent of their refined products and another five percent of their refined products, for a total reserve of 10 percent. Importers at present have to reserve five percent of the refined products they bring into the country. However, from January 1997, they would be required to double their stockpiles to 10.0 percent. The move was a preventive measure following the Gulf crisis of 1991. In an effort to ensure sufficient reserves for the country, Thailand raised the reserve requirement to 5.0 percent from 3.0 percent of oil supply in 1991. Thailand also set a goal then to eventually increase national reserves to 10.0 percewnt for imported refined products. Thailand imported 406,310 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil during the first seven months of 1996, a 40.9 percent increase over the same period last year. It imported 181,570 bpd of refined products during the same period.
MCAT	U.S. debt futures ended up ahead of inflation data to be released Thursday and Friday. Early losses were tied to tension between the U.S. and Iraq and renewed rate-hike worries, but futures cut losses before midday and drifted higher to close up in light trading. Traders said one Wall Street firm was a featured buyer all day, with some groups that had been sellers Tuesday returning as buyers on Wednesday. "It was a choppy, neutral-type day," a Treasury bond options trader said, noting positioning before the upcoming producer and consumer price indices.   August producer prices will be released at 0730 CDT/1230 GMT on Thursday and were forecast up 0.1 percent for both core and overall rates, against an unchanged overall rate in July and an 0.1-percent rise in the core rate. On Friday, consumer prices are due. The core and overall rates were forecast up 0.2 percent versus an 0.3-percent rise in July. Traders gleaned some support near midday from the Federal Reserve's beige book of economic activity, which cited more upward pressure on wages than prices, but called inflation signs "inconclusive."   Trading was light as many players took to the sidelines after squaring up their positions before the inflation data on Thursday and Friday. Some traders were looking ahead to Friday's August retail sales report. Overall sales were forecast up 0.7 percent against an 0.1-percent rise the previous week. Excluding the auto sector, sales were forecast up 0.4 percent compared with 0.3 percent. Bearishness in bonds from rallying oil prices amid tensions in Iraq was limited, some traders said. "I think it's a minor detail" unless tensions escalate and are sustained, a bond trader said.   Tensions there mounted on Wednesday amid reports Iraqi anti-aircraft missiles had been fired at U.S. planes. The United States warned Iraq that Washington was "not playing games" and said that firing on U.S. planes would provoke a "disproportionate" response from the U.S. December T-bonds closed up 4/32 to 106-25/32, T-notes ended flat at 105-24/32, muni-bonds rose 2/32 to 111-23/32, December Eurodollars ended flat at 93.94, and T-bills ended flat at 94.54. --Derivatives Desk 312-408-8750 E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com

CCAT	U.S.-based AT&T's Indian unit announced on Wednesday it had tied up finances for a $1.5 billion mobile phone network in India and said it was targeting a million subscribers spread over the nation's richest regions. Birla-AT&T Communications Ltd, in which AT&T holds a 49 percent stake and India's Aditya Birla group 51 percent, said it expected its cellular service under the AT&T brand to serve one million customers by 2006, compared to only 11,000 at present. "It is our strategic intent to build the country's largest cellular network," Kumar Mangalam Birla, the joint venture's chairman, told a news conference to announce a $283-million loan syndication for the project. "AT&T is currently the single largest foreign investor in India's telecommunications sector," Birla-AT&T said in a statement. Company officials said the network would yield profits after four years. Birla-AT&T won a 10-year licence to set up a mobile telephone network in India's richest state, Maharashtra, its fast-industrialising neighbour, Gujarat, and the nearby tourist haven of Goa on the Arabian Sea coast. AT&T's competitor in the Maharashtra zone, which does not include the state capital and India's financial centre, Bombay, is a joint venture between India's BPL group and US West Inc. The venture has not completed its financing yet. The loan syndication was arranged by Bank of America NT&SA through its subsidiary BA Asia and Toronto Dominion (Southeast Asia) Ltd. "Competition for funds is only to going to increase in this area," said Mark Hamilton, AT&T Wireless Services' executive vice-president, international operations and development. Company officials said the syndication, which comprises a foreign currency portion and a rupee tranche, involved India's biggest non-recourse external commercial borrowing in the telecommunications sector. This implies that all risks will be borne by lenders, except for a $65 million tranche where political risk is covered by EKN, the Swedish Export Credit Agency, they said. The 8-1/2-year-loan will carry interest at the rate of 125 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for the EKN portion. "The financing will allow Birla-AT&T to continue one of the fastest cellular network roll-outs in India," the statement said. Company officials could not immediately provide other details. India began opening up its telecommunications industry to private investors in 1994 under an economic reforms programme launched in 1991. Birla-AT&T has an equity base of around $150 million and has the Indian government's approval to raise it to up to $340 million. The company is committed to an overall debt-equity ratio of 1.25 to 1.0, company officials said. The Aditya Birla group's 51 percent stake in the joint venture is spread among Grasim Ltd, which has 17.6 percent, Hindalco Ltd with 19.4 percent, Indian Rayon and Industries Ltd with 9.9 percent and Indo Gulf Industries Ltd with 4.1 percent. -- New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024

GCAT	Pierce Brosnan, known for his role as sauve British secret service agent James Bond, has found exotic Thailand a hot act. Too hot. Brosnan has been in Bangkok filming the latest Bond movie in which he rides across Bangkok rooftops on a motorcycle, a feat he said the city's frustrated commuters should not imitate to beat its notorious traffic jams. But he conceded on Thursday that the 40 degree Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) heat had finally knocked him out. Brosnan's first words at a press conference that drew big laughs from the media were: "Water, water. Hot, hot, hot, hot really." The Irish-born actor, here to film "Tomorrow Never Dies", said: "We were filming...on a motorcycle in part of Bangkok which was very colourful and very hot," Brosnan said. Bangkok's 40 degree Celsius plus temperatures in the past month have pushed power consumption to a 30-year high as Thais retreat to air-conditioned rooms. "Tomorrow Never Dies" producer Michael Wilson said his crew originally planned to shoot the movie in Vietnam but the team was forced to shift the location to Bangkok because of problems with the Vietnamese authorities.

GCAT	Britain's leading election experts on Wednesday predicted the opposition Labour party was on course for a commanding victory in an election which they said was testing the patience of voters to the limit. In a survey of predictions from 20 political experts on the outcome of the May 1 election, the average forecast was for a 79-seat Labour majority in the 659-seat parliament, just off the 83-seat majority predicted by the same experts a week ago. Just one of the experts opted for a hung parliament. The other 19 forecast a Labour win in the first-past-the-post constituency race, four of them saying they expected a Labour landslide majority of more than 100 seats. But at just past the half-way point in the six-week campaign, a marathon by British standards, both the major parties seemed to be losing the hearts and minds of an electorate despairing of the mud-slinging and in-fighting. "Despite all the experts and spin-doctors, it's been an incredibly dull campaign, although the Conservatives have been particularly awful," said David Denver, political scientist at the University of Lancaster. The campaign was dominated in its early days by sex and financial scandals, mainly hitting the Conservative party, and this has set the tone for a battle which campaign watchers say is Britain's dirtiest-ever. The latest predictions from the Reuters pundits continued to be less optimistic for Labour than public opinion polls, most of which give the party a lead of around 20 percentage points. The latest Reuters/NOP opinion poll, conducted on April 4, gave Labour a 21-point margin. The panel's average prediction for how parties will share the popular vote gives Labour just a nine-point lead on 44 percent, with John Major's beleaguered Conservatives on 35 percent. In Wednesday's weekly update, the Liberal Democrats were forecast to take 15 percent and other parties, including nationalists and single-issue groups, were projected to take six percent. The experts said they expected the gap between the opinion polls and their own predictions to narrow in the final days of the campaign. Analyst David Carlton of the University of Warwick, who predicts a hung parliament, said the traditional perception of Labour being taxers and spenders would favour the Conservative party as people entered the polling booth. "There was a late surge in Conservative support (at the last election) in 1992 which is widely believed to be the result of the Conservatives' record on economic issues," said Carlton, the only panellist to predict anything other than a Labour victory. Some panellists said campaign issues had retreated further from voters' minds because of the negative tone of the campaign, although education and economic management were voted the most topical subjects. The need for a change of government after 18 years of Conservative rule was emerging as the dominant factor of the election, they said. "If you want to rate the election campaign, the two main parties are playing towards a goalless draw. They have been evenly matched, both have had attacking chances but neither has driven the ball home," said Ivor Crewe, vice-chancellor of the University of Essex. "And any spectator will tell you that goalless draws are boring," he added. University of Essex political scientist David Sanders said the minority opposition Liberal Democrats, for which the panel gave an average prediction of 15 percent of the national vote, had benefited well from the negative campaigning of the major parties. "The Liberal Democrats have very sensibly stood by while the other two parties slug it out. They have come along looking polite and sensible at the end," he said. The panel predicted on average that the turnout would be 74 percent, slightly down on the last election and symptomatic of the confusion in voters' minds, particularly the young, the analysts said. --London Polling Unit +44 171 542 5223
ECAT	Brazil's inflation-slashing Real Plan turns three years old next week, which for Central Bank director Gustavo Franco will mark one more victory over the "prophets of doom" who see trouble on the nation's economic horizon. "What makes this anniversary so important is the fact that we still have prophets of doom proclaiming we are on the verge of collapse. So having survived another year looks like a feat," Franco told Reuters in an interview late Monday.   The controversial director of the Central Bank's international affairs department is one of the key architects of the Real Plan, which has cut annual inflation from a dizzying 2,700 percent in 1994 to single digits today. The plan's cornerstone was the introduction of the Real, which has proven to be country's first stable currency since the mid-1980s. While Franco acknowledges Brazil needs to push ahead with constitutional amendments designed to solidify the Real Plan with sound fiscal and tax reform, he said the country had made irreversible advances on the economic front.   "There is still unfinished business in the plan, but I think we have done a good job. We have changed the face of this country," he said. Franco has been criticized at home and abroad for using a strong currency to tame inflation at the expense of economic growth and as a crutch in place of stringent fiscal discipline.   Critics like Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Rudiger Dornbusch say the distorted mix of tight monetary and loose fiscal policies will lead to an unsustainable current account deficit, which most economists expect to top 4.0 percent of gross domestic product this year and about 5.0 percent in 1998. Eventually, critics argue, foreign investors will no longer be willing to finance the shortfall. That will force the government to devalue the currency, returning Brazil to crisis and hyperinflation. Not so, says Franco.   The recent success of a $3.0 billion 30-year global bond issue and Brady bond swap and a flood of foreign direct investment are clear signs of strong investor faith in Brazil, Franco said. Although progress will eventually have to be made on constitutional reforms that will allow federal, state and local  governments to slash personnel and pension costs, worries over an economic crisis were exaggerated, Franco said.   "We have come to a point where we can say reforms are essential, yes. But it is no longer a question of the Real Plan collapsing and hyperinflation coming back the next day," he said. "It is a question of whether we are going to have economic growth of two percent or six percent. That is a much better problem to be facing," Franco said. Brazil's federal budget deficit, which is on the mend but still gaping, prevents the government from lowering real interest rates, now at an annualized 12 percent, which has kept economic growth in check.   Improving fiscal performance will also help Brazil lengthen maturities on its domestic debt, which Franco said was one of the Real Plan's main challenges as it enters its fourth year. The average maturity on locally issued debt is about six months. But Brazil recently sold foreign investors 30-year and 20-year maturities in global debt markets, which are already well supplied with five and 10-year paper. When asked when people would stop keeping track of the Real Plan's birthday, Franco said: "It may be that when the average maturities on the internal and external debt are comparable, when the plan is 10 years old perhaps, the anniversary will have little interest."

MCAT	Just when everyone thought that the longest bull market ever was heading for a fall, Wall Street enjoyed a spectacular rally, and the experts see more jolly good times for stocks next year. It was another week of La Dolce Vita for bullish investors as the market roared back up after it was sent reeling on concern about rising interest rates and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's now famous warning of irrational exuberance in financial markets. The strongest bull market of all time exploded anew, with the Dow Jones industrial average racking up its second biggest gain in history as the so-called Santa Claus rally came to Wall Street. The index of 30-blue-chip stocks Thursday leaped 126.87 points -- its steepest rise since a scorching 186.84 points gain on Oct. 21, 1987. In late trading Friday, the Dow was up 40.75 at 6,514.39, nearing its record close of 6,547.79 set on Nov. 25. For the week, it was up 242.92 points. What made the Dow's jump even more dazzling was the fact that it was just coming off a loss of 200 points after November's fierce rally of 500 points. Stocks have been on a fast-paced rise for the last six years and on a rocket ride this year, soaring more than 1,300 points since January. The experts say investors are comfortable with the way the economy is buzzing along, growing at a comfortable pace with inflation subdued. With less than two weeks left before 1996 is history, analysts say things are fundamentally the same and there was nothing worrisome in the economy's future that could dramatically change the course of the market. The interest rate environment is still favourable, inflation is not threatening and the economy is growing but at a more subdued pace, which paints a rosy scenario for stocks. The United States also has become the home of the world's strongest stock market, they say, and it is a magnet for foreign investment. And, the way stocks close out the year may be a sign of how they will do in 1997, at least in the early part of the year. "This is the mother of all bull markets," said James Dines, publisher of the Dines Letter in Belvedere, Calif. "And I'm still bullish for 1997." "Seasonally, we get a November peak, early December sell-off and a late December rally, and that's exactly the blueprint that we have been getting," he said. Don Hays, chief investment strategist at Wheat First Butcher Singer in Richmond, Va., is also in the bullish camp, and he sees even better days for stocks in the new year. "We expect the next 12 months to witness the best rally in small-caps since the 1960s," Hays says. "This should occur when today's sceptics finally realise that this is the beginning of a great new 14-year growth phase that the U.S. and the world is about to enjoy," he said. Still there is a growing body of analysts who say the rally has gone on too long and fear that the roaring bull market is on collision course with a growling bear. The experts say the market cannot go up indefinitely at the pace of the last two years because stocks prices may be out of whack with the underlying growth of corporate America. Some experts this week raised the warning flag of caution. Morgan Stanley's U.S. and global strategists said that next year will be the toughest that stock traders have faced since 1990, and may in fact represent the early stage of a bear market. Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley Global Strategist, said, "My intuition is that a correction at best and possibly a real bear market in stocks has just begun, and that 1997 is going to be a down year for most U.S. equity portfolios." Merrill Lynch's Chief Investment Strategist Charles Clough said he felt the market was vulnerable to a correction next year, saying "the risk is earnings and how that works through stock prices in 1997." Much of the concern is that while the economy will continue to grow next year, the gain might not be enough to support corporate earnings and justify the stock market's valuation. "Any market correction will hold off until later in the second quarter of next year and even then stocks are likely to give up ground reluctantly," said Arnold Kaufman at Standard & Poor's. He said that the market might also fall victim to historical cyclic patterns. "Two years of outsized gains are almost never followed by a third year of above average performance," Kaufman said. After back-to-back gains in the mid-70s and mid-50s, the stock market had flat years. "The big correction," he said, "could come in 1998 when there will be a decent chance of a recession, with the economic expansion certainly getting long in the tooth."

GCAT	Internazionale's beleaguered English coach Roy Hodgson will try to turn abuse into praise against runaway Juventus on Wednesday. Hodgson was insulted and his players pelted with missiles when they slumped 4-3 at home to Sampdoria in the league on Sunday after leading 3-1. Now he must plot the downfall of the Turin giants in an Italian Cup quarter-final at the San Siro. Fortunately for Hodgson, his team hold a 3-0 first leg advantage. Sunday's reverse plunged the one-time leaders to fifth in the table, seven points behind Juventus. The defeat followed a run of four draws against Fiorentina, AC Milan, Cagliari and Vicenza and prompted speculation that Inter's championship challenge is faltering. But Hodgson argued that the defeat was merely a momentary setback. "I'm not angry but I am disappointed. This isn't the time to get angry even if a 4-3 home loss is a disastrous result," he said. "We're thinking about the Italian Cup and the UEFA Cup, and even if this is obviously a bad day, there are still 21 more games to be played before the end of the league season." Inter president Massimo Moratti dismissed speculation that Hodgson's position was once again in jeopardy. "This is not the time for emotional decisions which, anyway, would be unjust," he said. "We'll keep going as we are." Juventus showed contrastingly resilient form as they recovered from 0-2 to beat Verona 3-2 -- a comeback that troubles Inter's experienced defender, Giuseppe Bergomi. "You'd have to be worried by a side that can come back like that -- and I have seen that their coach, Lippi, has said that he hasn't forgotten the first leg of our cup tie, so you'd have to be uneasy."

MCAT	NYMEX electricity futures finished up strongly Friday following behind physical power prices driven higher by cooling demand in the Southwest, industry sources said. "For the most part (the futures rise) is based on the cash prices," said one Houston-based futures trader. In the Western physical market, firm, peak electricity at the California-Oregon Border (COB) for Monday was assessed at $24.50-25.50 per megawatt hour (MWh) from $22.00-24.00 on Thursday for Friday delivery. Firm, peak Palo Verde (PV) electricity for Monday jumped to $44.00-46.00 from $39.00-43.00 for today. The short-term power prices were pushed up by Southwest air conditioning demand and generation constraints through the West, industry sources said. Despite an increase in power prices through the week, sources said the cash and the futures markets may have topped out, with forecasts of some cooler Western weather next week. "There did appear to be a bit of a top in the cash today with the utilities coming out to sell at these high numbers," the Houston trader said. June PV futures finished up $1.44 at $25.70 after hitting a new contract high of $26.25 and a low of $25.00, while July was up $1.40 at $27.60 after hitting a new high of $27.75 and a low of $27.00 per MWh. Remaining PV futures finished up between 10 and 77 cents. June COB NYMEX futures settled up $1.35 at $19.53 following trade at a new contract high of $19.95 and a low of $18.60, while July COB ended up 80 cents at $20.00 after hitting a new high of $20.20 and a low of $19.50 per megawatt hour (MWh). Remaining COB deferreds settled up between 10 and 81 cents per MWh. NYMEX said an estimated total of 446 COB and 738 PV contracts changed hands. The interior section of the Southwest was expected to experience temperatures five to 10 degrees above normal, while coastal areas were expected to be four to eight degrees above normal through the weekend. Temperatures were expected to cool to slightly above normal early next week. In the Northwest, temperatures were expected to be five to 10 degrees above normal through Sunday and then cool to one to five degrees above normal early next week. A number of Western generation facilities remained out of service, while Northwest hydropower dams were operating at reduced output due to flood-control restrictions. The 400 MW Bonanza coal-fired station in Utah was scheduled to shut Friday for a two-week maintenance outage.

MCAT	U.S. high-yield corporate bond prices rose slightly on Monday as investors began to express renewed optimism about the market's short-term outlook. "On Friday dealers tried to run up the market. But today we're seeing a broader pickup in buying. Many accounts may be starting to buy to avoid missing the bottom," said one trader. After a four-week correction that widened spreads on the average high-yield bond by about 20 basis points, junk bond spreads seem to have found a floor, analysts said.   Traders reported junk bonds were up 1/4 to 1/2 a point on Monday on moderate trading. Market experts said market sentiment was buoyed last Friday when AMG Data Services reported that cash flows into the high-yield market turned positive after four straight weeks of outflows. Mutual fund cash flows are a widely watched indicator of the health of the high-yield market because mutual funds are a significant source of demand for high-yield bonds and often react the earliest in a market correction.   Trading activity in the investment-grade market was quiet on Monday as investors prepared for what is expected to be a heavy week of new issuance, traders said. Spreads among high-grade bonds were unchanged at the end of the day on extremely low trading, they said. In credit-specific news, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Cityscape Financial Corp's subordinated debt to B1 from B2 on Monday. The downgrade comes several weeks before Cityscape is expected to debut in high-yield market with a $300 million senior note offering via CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Corp.
GCAT	Turkish Cypriot authorities on Wednesday closed a U.N. checkpoint to Greek Cypriots and the Maronite community living in the north of the divided island in response to a Greek Cypriot protest discouraging tourists from visiting their breakaway state. "Instructions have been given that as from today Greek Cypriots and Maronites will not be allowed to cross to the south of the island," Turkish Cypriot police spokeswoman Perwin Gurler told Reuters. She said she did not know how long the order would be in effect. The move sparked an angry reaction from the Cypriot government. "This is a very serious matter and we are going to react strongly to this," said Cypriot government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides. He said apart from protests to the United Nations, the government would consider contacting the European Parliament and other institutions for the protection of human rights. The blockade followed a warning by officials in the Turkish Cypriot administration, which is recognised only by Turkey, that they would close the checkpoint on their side unless a weekend protest by Greek Cypriots stopped. "This is one of the worst types of blackmail. We will never give in," said Marios Matsakis, the Greek Cypriot MP who started the protests. "We will fight (Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf) Denktash with greater determination," he said. Nearly five hundred mostly elderly Greek Cypriots live in the Karpasia peninsula in the north of the island and 187 Maronites, who belong to a branch of the Roman Catholic church in the Middle East, live in another village in the northwest. They are allowed to visit their families in the south of the island only after receiving permission from authorities in the breakaway state, and on designated days. Turkish Cypriots have imposed crossing restrictions in the past at times of heightened tension on the island. Two Greek Cypriot families who had arrived in the southern government-controlled part of the island on Friday were not allowed to return to their homes in the northern village of Rizzokarpasso when they arrived at the checkpoint on Wednesday. The group waited for three hours at the checkpoint, then returned to the south. "We went to cross over and the Turkish Cypriots told us we could go back when Matsakis leaves," said one woman in the group. "I have four children over there." The family had gone to the south to christen their youngest child. Several trucks carrying food for the Greek Cypriots were allowed to cross into the north. Cyprus has been divided since Turkey invaded and occupied its the northern third in 1974 following a short-lived coup in Nicosia engineered by the military ruling Greece.
ECAT	Following are economists' reactions to a report from the Bundesbank on Friday showing that annualised M3 money supply in May rose 7.0 percent from the 1996 fourth quarter. In April M3 grew 6.7 percent. HANS-JUERGEN MELTZER, ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK, FRANKFURT: "It is above the expectations. However we should not put too much emphasis on this. There might have been specific factors that moved up the demand for money, particularly the higher number of vacation days in May that decreased the demand for money in circulation.   "Credit demand appears to be high, so this should be good news. It is in line with the good improvement in the Ifo climate index that we saw yesterday. "I do not see a new trend for M3. I think we have a good chance to get back into the corridor in the next few months. Whether it is next month remains to be seen. "I am optimistic particularly that capital formation will pick up again. We should not overlook that companies are paying higher wages that have (now) been computed. That should raise the capital formation. "I do not think that this number will be a drag (on Bund markets) for long. More important is what is going on in the United States and EMU uncertainties instead of Germany. I do not think the market will assume that the new number will lead to a change in monetary policy.   NICK STAMENKOVIC, ECONOMIST, DKB INTERNATIONAL, LONDON: "It is good news for the government but not for the Bund market. The numbers were a bit disappointing. We saw a slowdown in capital formation, which is a reflection of reluctance among Germans to put their money into domestic investments (corrects to remove reference to inflation). "Today's figures will delay the move into the (M3 target) range but I think we will be back into the range by the fourth quarter. "The Bundesbank does not look at M3 itself. They are pragmatic. I see now reason that they will change policy anytime soon. I think it is slightly negative for the Bund market. "There are also a lot of uncertainities about EMU and the risks for a broader EMU and a softer euro. For now, I expect German markets to be following Treasuries."   PETRA KOEHLER, ECONOMIST, DRESDNER BANK, FRANKFURT: "It is good news for the economy because higher private lending should indicate that the economic recovery is going on. "We had quite a high uncertainity in Bund markets in May over the Bundesbank gold reserve issue. That played a role. "I think we should have stronger monetary capital formation for next month and have a good chance to reach the target corridor. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

CCAT	Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport is proceeding with plans to build a new commuter runway although it has not reached agreeement with the airlines on how to fund the facility, the Atlanta Journal and Constitution reported Friday. The newspaper said the city will ask the Federal Avition Administration for permission to charge a $3 tax on airline tickets. If approved, the tax would probably take effect by May 1997 and would raise enough money to design the runway and buy the land. The city had asked the airlines to fund construction of the runway through an increase in landing fees but the carriers, led by Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, rejected the request in June. Airport general manager Angela Gittens told the newspaper that the city wants to keep moving forward and hopes to reopen negotiations with the airlines. The added runway has become more crucial under new FAA regulations that increased the required distance between certain aircraft for safety reasons. Hartsfield must cut flight capacity by 19 percent in order to maintain the required distances, Gittens said. But adding the new runway will boost capacity and eliminate the delays, saving the airlines about $37 million a year, Gittens said. --Jane Sutton, 305-374-5013

CCAT	French property company Unibail said on Friday it was setting up a property investment fund aimed at non-domestic investors. Crossroads Property Investors will be the first property investment fund for foreign institutions managed by a French operator, Unibail chairman Leon Bressler told a news conference. It will target U.S. and European funds. The fund will bring together 12 investors and raise 1.2 billion francs in equity which will generate an investment potential of five billion. The biggest investors, including Unibail, will not hold more than 20 percent of the equity. The fund will buy assets in the office and commercial sector as well as property portfolios. It will aim for a yield of more than 20 percent on equity, Bressler said. Unibail earlier announced first-half net attributable profit of 142 million francs versus 140.9 million a year ago. -- Paris newsroom +33 1 4221 5452
MCAT	U.S. mortgage-backed securities held modest losses in afternoon trade Wednesday as many market participants refrained from active trade, mortgage experts said. Pass-through yield spreads to comparable Treasuries were mostly unchanged in relatively quiet trade, they said. "It's dead. Everybody is waiting for the (employment) number," said one trader at a regional brokerage firm.   A head Ginnie trader in New York said Tuesday's large buyer of conventional mortgages, which had been used for a short-hedge position, were unloaded back into the market. That action put some weight on mortgage prices, he said. A small amount of seven-year balloons and three-year agency collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) paper was bought today, the trader said. But the size of the purchase was "nothing to write home about," he added. In late trade, Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5-percent issues were off 5/32 at 99-28/32, yielding 98 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note.   Comparable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issues were down 4/32, at 99-27/32 and 100 even, respectively. The five-year Treasury note was off 2/32 at 6.49 percent, while the 10-year note was off 1/32 to yield 6.62 percent. The U.S. labor department is scheduled to release the May employment data on Friday at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT. On average, 22 economists in a Reuters poll had forecast payrolls rose to 219,000 in May from 142,000 in April. They projected the unemployment rate would inch up to 5.0 percent in May from 4.9 percent in the previous month. (( -- Jeff Coelho, 212-859-1660 ))
GCAT	The Argentine government on Friday reached an out-of-court settlement with a Jewish businessman who was tortured and forced into exile under a military dictatorship that ruled during the "Dirty War" of the 1970s. "Somewhat late, I have achieved justice," said Jose Siderman, 85, who filed a civil suit against the Argentine government 14 years ago in a U.S. court. His son, Carlos Siderman, told reporters the settlement would be donated to the Siderman Foundation for Human Rights, but declined to provide details on terms of the agreement. Siderman, now a U.S. citizen, was suing the Argentine government for the loss of business and properties valued at more than $25 million and for the suffering he and his family had endured. It was the first time a U.S. court had allowed a lawsuit to proceed against a foreign government, alleging human rights abuses that had taken place on foreign soil. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the case to go forward because Argentina used a U.S. court to serve Siderman with an Argentine lawsuit, effectively waiving its sovereign immunity in the process. In a last minute flurry of negotiations, the Argentine government, which had steadfastly resisted a settlement, reached an agreement with Siderman's lawyers that avoided a potentially embarrassing civil trial just as it was about to begin. Paul Hoffmann, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union which represented the Sidermans, called the settlement a "victory for human rights around the globe," but it was unclear whether the Argentine government has formally accepted liability for Siderman's ordeal. Carlos Siderman said the president of Argentina had promised to make an official apology, but they had not yet received one. Siderman, the prosperous owner of a construction business, was abducted on March 24, 1976, the night the Argentine military staged a bloody coup. He was taken by hooded soldiers to an undisclosed location where he was tortured and subjected to anti-Semitic epithets. He suffered broken ribs and lost a testicle while being held for seven days and was told he would be killed if he did not leave Argentina. "One of the main reasons that I had so many problems was because of my Jewish descendancy," Siderman said. Carlos Siderman said: "It has been a long road since 1976. My father has done nothing else except fight the system. We are happy this struggle is over," Siderman told reporters, sometimes fighting back tears. He said his father planned to continue to fight for human rights. After Siderman fled Argentina to live in California, the family's properties were confiscated by the military. The military regime's generals charged Siderman with fraud and issued international warrants for his arrest. During a vacation in Italy in 1981, he was thrown into jail and placed under house arrest before Argentina's extradition request was denied.
CCAT	Viacom Inc management is emphasising Blockbuster's core video-rental business, retreating from a plan by the unit's former head to push into retailing, the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday. Blockbuster's former chief Bill Fields had opened test outlets which looked like convenience stores, selling soft drinks and junk food, the newspaper said. The Journal quoted Viacom deputy chairman, Tom Dooley, as saying: "We want people to think of Blockbuster as a place to go to rent tapes. There was too much emphasis on retail at the expense of the core rental business." Dooley was also quoted by the Journal as saying Viacom was watching the number of people needed for Blockbuster's new headquarter operations in Dallas, and that the final number could be less than the 1,000 employees Fields saw.
CCAT	Global Village Communications Inc shipped this week a product that allows personal computer users to get constant flashes of news from the Internet without an ongoing Internet connection. Called "NewsCatcher," the services uses a wireless receiver for PCs. The user can program software in the reciever-holding PC to track and collect news customized to the user's interests. The wireless receiver then pulls news updates from the airwaves, using news gathered by Global Villages's partner in the product AirMedia Live Inc. The PC, with AirMedia software, then presents that news to the user.   Global Village manufacturers the receiver. The Sunnyvale-based company said it developed the "NewsCatcher" package of receiver and software in response to market demand for faster information gathering than what it takes to surf through various sites on the Internet. "Our solution is a wireless device that does the surfing for them without connecting to the Internet, saving time and keeping them informed, so they instantly know everything from from when to buy and sell their stocks to who won the big game," said vice president Charlie Oppenheimer, manager of Global Village's communications systems division, in a statement.   The AirMedia Live Internet Broadcast Network collects information from Knight-Ridder Inc, Reuters Holdings Plc, The Sports Network, TravelGram, Quote.Com, Lotto World and CompuServe and other online content providers. News updates are transmitted from the AirMedia broadcast center in New York through the airvaves to NewsCatcher receivers, which lets users get the news as the same time as on-line sites are updated, the companies said. The service allows PC users to get news without closing down non-Internet programs they're working on. NewsCathers also alerts users to incoming e-mail without logging on.   Shipments of NewsCather began Monday at a price of $149 for the receiver and the information service is free for the first year and $24.95 a year or $2 a month afterward.  The e-mail alert is an additional charge of $9.95 a month. A spokesman for Global Village said no hard data on sales or shipments had been gathered yet, but that "retailers are lining up to sell it." Initially NewsCather is distributed through CompUSA,  Best Buy and Computer City.

GCAT	Eight Zambian opposition politicians detained on suspicion of treason last year are suing the state for malicious and wrongful prosecution, their lawyers said on Wednesday. The eight, all members of former president Kenneth Kaunda's United National Independence Party (UNIP), are demanding $192,000 each from the state. The claim follows their acquittal on treason charges last year. "We have written to the Attorney General on behalf of our clients demanding compensatation of 250 million Kwacha each," opposition lawyer Sakwiba Sikota told Reuters. The opposition leaders include Kaunda's deputy, Inyambo Yeta, and his press aide Muhabi Lungu. The eight were detained last June in connection with a spate of explosions allegedly carried out by a group called the "Black Mamba". The government claimed the blasts were intended to deter it from passing controversial new laws that banned some candidates, including Kaunda, from contesting elections held last November. The new laws prompted western governments to cut aid to Zambia and led to Kaunda's UNIP and six other opposition parties boycotting the elections, which President Frederick Chiluba's Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) won by a landslide. One policeman was killed and another wounded in one of the explosions early last year. Home-made explosives also caused minor damage to the outer wall of the presidential residence, and to the offices of a state-run newspaper. Two of the suspects were released in September after the state withdrew charges against them. The rest were acquitted by the Lusaka High Court in November. Lungu said the former detainees believed their arrests were intended to disrupt their election campaign and to justify a government clampdown against the opposition. "There is no doubt that the whole exercise was political. Ruling party cadres dictated to the police who should be arrested and trumped up charges against us," he told reporters. ($1=1,300 Kwacha)
GCAT	Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Tuesday endorsed the Papua New Guinea government's decision to sack its defence chief.   "We utterly deplore the attempts of (the) former commander-in-chief of the Papua New Guinea defence force to defy the authority of the duly-elected government of Papua New Guinea," Howard told parliament in a special announcement. "In the circumstances, the action taken by the prime minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Julius Chan, to remove the head of the defence force was both understandable and justifiable." Howard said the government would continue to monitor the situation and the safety of Australians in Papua New Guinea. Chan sacked defence chief Brigadier-General Jerry Singirok late on Monday after the military chief demanded Chan's resignation over plans to use mercenaries in the war against secessionist rebels on Bougainville island.

ECAT	Colombia's consumer price index rose a sharper-than-expected 1.19 percent in September, the National Statistics Department (DANE) said. As measured on an accumulated basis for the first nine months of the year, it said the index had now risen 18.43 percent, well over the central bank's 17 percent target for the entire year. The rise in the price index during September compares with a 0.84 percent increase in the same month last year. Real inflation this year is expected to exceed 21 percent, according to most independent estimates. Inflation over the past 12 months stands at 21.55 percent, according to the figures released by DANE.  It gave no comparative figure for inflation between September 1994 and September 1995. -- Tom Brown, Bogota newsroom, 571 610 7944
MCAT	Istanbul shares edged slightly higher in rangebound trade on Tuesday as the lack of market moving news and liquidity inflow persisted, brokers said. The IMKB National-100 closed at 2,036, up four points, or 0.2 percent from Monday. It moved in a tight range between 2,021 and 2,047 during the day. Trade volume also improved 14.8 percent to 15.2 trillion lira ($92.8 million) on Tuesday, from Monday's 13.23 trillion. Brokers said only selective activity was possible with the present transaction volume, so trade focused on shares with high first half profit results or expectations. "There are not much market moving expectations other than first half figures. Domestic investors are unable to move the market due to the lack of liquidity and the bourse needs new foreign investors," said Gokhan Kolay from Polen Securities. Companies are required to release their mid-year financial tables by Friday, at the latest. "Speculators who still keep their short-term positions try some speculative moves in certain shares, but nobody follows them. Personally, I would wait for the index to fall below 2,000," said Murat Aysen from Finans Securities. Of the 252 shares traded, 94 advanced, 91 declined and 67 ended stable. The IMKB Industrial inched 0.1 percent to 1,963, the IMKB Services firmed 0.96 percent to 2,003 and the IMKB Financial  gained 0.32 percent to 2,210.

CCAT	Brazilian mining group Paranapanema's 1996 loss is the result of the company's restructuring program and last year's plunge in world copper prices, a company official said. Paranapanema posted a 1996 net loss of 79.5 million reais ($75 million), down from a net loss of 12.8 million reais ($12 million) the previous year. "To a large extent the results are related to our restructuring program," said Market Relations Director Helio Blak. "They also reflect last year's fall in international copper prices." The company is carrying out an extensive restructuring program after a group of pension funds acquired control of Paranapanema and another three mining firms in February last year to form a mining conglomerate.

ECAT	A French business delegation arrived in Asmara late on Saturday to discuss ways of expanding trade and investment with Africa's youngest state. Eritrea, which became independent after breaking away from Ethiopia, in May 1993, has invited foreign firms to bid for a range of businesses scheduled for privatisation. The delegation is travelling under the flag of CNPF (Conseil National du Patronat Francaise), the French employers' organisation. It is headed by Michel Roussin, former minister of co-operation in France (1993-94), and presently chairman of the CNPF committee for relations with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. French embassy sources said the delegation included representatives from tourism, engineering, banking, brewing, mining, leather and water supply sectors. In July last year, Eritrea announced its intention to privatise most government-controlled industries. Nine industries were later put up for sale, and the successful bidders are expected to be named soon. A second batch of companies is due to be offered for sale later this month. The French delegation is due to travel to Ethiopia on May 13.
MCAT	NYMEX electricity futures are called to open lower Wednesday, extending this week's steep drop on outlook of seasonal temperatures and more generation capacity returning to operation in the West. "Definitely lower, but nothing dramatic," said a West Coast electricity dealer. In over-the-counter activity, July California-Oregon Border (COB) futures were quoted at $16.90-17.10 a megawatt hour (MWh) down from Tuesday's settlement at $17.61, and July Palo Verde (PV) $26.40-27.00 below yesterday's close at $27.66. So far this week, July COB lost $6.83 or 27.9 percent of their value, while July PV fell $5.80 or 17.4 percent. Analysts pegged short-term support for July COB at $17.00 and for July PV at $27.00 after they violated their uptrend lines on yesterday's drop. If the front month contracts maintain technical support, they could head for a rebound and fill the chart gaps at $19.25-20.25 for July COB and $28.30-30.30 for July PV. Market sources said a firming of natural gas futures would help halt the power complex's decline. "It'll slow the fall. It'll lend it support," said the West Coast dealer. NYMEX July Henry Hub natgas futures opened 4.2 cents at $2.140 per million British thermal units.

He added that it was inappropriate to discuss the possibility of a rise in Japan's official discount rate now, Jiji said.
ECAT	Roosevelt & Cross, Inc., said it won $2.223 million of No. Colonie CSD, N.Y., school district bonds, 1997, with a net interest cost of 4.7056 percent (corrects from 4.0756 percent).
GCAT	Gheorghe Popescu, Ronaldo and Juan Pizzi saved the blushes of Barcelona team mate Carlos Busquets on Thursday by bringing their team back from a first-minute deficit to beat AIK Stockholm 3-1 in their Cup Winners' Cup quarter-final first leg. A huge gaffe by reserve goalkeeper Busquets allowed Pascal Simpson to score in the opening seconds at the Camp Nou but the home side struck straight back and could easily have put six past the Swedes. Romania's Popescu equalised from a set-piece in the second minute, Ronaldo put his side ahead with a superb header early in the second half and the Brazilian then set up strike partner Juan Pizzi for the third 15 minutes from time. Both sides had a man sent off to end the game with 10 men, while Busquets redeemed himself a little in a rare AIK attack in the dying moments.
CCAT	Finnish state railways VR-Yhtyma Oy said in a statement on Wednesday that the group's January-April pre-tax profit at 47 million markka was about four million markka up on its own expecation. Group net sales rose to 1.8 billion markka. VR gave no comparable figures, saying this was because its previous financial year was 18 months long. The current financial year is calendar 1997. VR said the volume of cargo carried on its trains in January-April increased by 16 percent on the year-ago period to 13.7 million tonnes. Passenger traffic rose slightly, VR said.   Full-year cargo transport volume was expected to be about 40 million tonnes, VR said, but gave no comparison. Full-year passenger volumes would rise 1-2 percent, it added. VR said it expected to reach its 1997 earnings targets, but did not say what the targets were. --Helsinki Newsroom  +358 - 9 - 680 50 245
MCAT	A push from New York straightened up London cocoa futures after a wave of origin selling, with the March contract ending at the technically-sensitive 1,000 stg on Thursday. Traders said advances in New York dragged London higher with the help of light arbitrage buying and as the market seemed to take a break from aggressive origin sales. "As you can see from the volume the hedging hasn't had a massive impact. It is there but perhaps not as aggressive as in the previous days," said one trader. The benchmark second-month March contract spent most of the session in negative territory, hopping to 1,000 stg in late trade after a failed attempt in early trade. It ended unchanged from Wednesday's close while other contracts recorded scattered losses. Volume totalled a slim 3,242 lots and switches were flat with Dec/March remaining at this week's confirmed price of 28-29 stg and May/May at 60 stg, traders said. Sterling has been the driving force behind heavy sales from French speaking African origins this week as it steadily moved higher against the franc. It is now well above eight francs to the pound, a level not seen since early 1995. A strong sterling also dried up any potential industry buying. "Industry buyers are naturally cautious but they are looking at the market and having to pay five or six percent more than they would have done a month or two ago," said another trader. The physical market is awaiting the start of Ivorian arrivals which were due to begin officially on Tuesday. Traders said a ministerial meeting of cocoa producers in Gabon this week could be one reason for the delay in Ivorian arrivals while the government has yet to set farm-gate and freight rates. Arrivals in Bahia meanwhile totalled 1.7 million 60-kg bags in the week ending October 13, compared with 1.085 million in the same period last year. If March consolidates its position above 1,000 stg, it may move on towards critical resistance at 1,025 stg, analysts said. -- Clelia Oziel, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8072
CCAT	Aviation industry sources said on Friday KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV was considering stepping up its ex-Sweden freight capacity. KLM said, however, that no decision had been made. Earlier Skavsta airport spokesman Peter Rogeman said the airport, located 100 kms southwest of Stockholm, was expecting a new daily cargo operation to start soon. The operation would mean the airport would handle between 20,000 and 25,000 tonnes of freight in 1997 compared to 8,500 tonnes in 1996. An aviation insider said it was KLM that was planning to start flights from the airport. "As far as I heard, it's a Belfast freighter that has roughly a 30 tonne payload," one source said. Another source said an Elektra with a 15 tonne capacity would be put on the route two days a week and the Belfast would fly three days a week. KLM sales director for northern Europe Michael Steen said there were a lot of rumours about this buzzing in the market. "We have been discussing options...No decision has been made," he told Reuters. -- Abigail Schmelz, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700-1003
GCAT	Mali, a star of Africa's democracy movement in the 1990s, held a rerun of a scrapped April parliamentary election on Sunday with the radical opposition boycotting the poll. Witnesses said that turnout was low in the first half of the day after opposition activists ransacked and torched the national headquarters of the West African nation's ruling ADEMA alliance and a town hall in the capital Bamako on Saturday. Voting in Bamako began on time at 8 a.m. (0800 GMT). Many would-be voters delayed their departure, asking about security at polling stations. The city itself was calm. Reports from the provinces said the pattern was the same. Police and paramilitary gendarmes were out in force. President Alpha Oumar Konare, reelected for five years in May, played down the pre-poll violence. "Violence from whatever quarter can never resolve problems," he said after voting. Almost 600 candidates from his Alliance for Democracy in Mali (ADEMA), 18 other parties and 13 independent lists contested the 147 national assembly seats. Just over five million Malians were eligible to vote. Konare's prime minister, Ibrahim Keita, said those responsible for the vandalism would be prosecuted. Konare himself said Sunday's polling would enable the mainly Moslem former French colony "to consolidate the rule of law and deepen the democratic process". Police and paramilitary gendarmes using tear gas dispersed the opposition activists on Saturday night when they attacked the two buildings and burned tyres following a protest march by 3,000 protesters backing the boycott campaign. Mali was widely praised for its 1992 transition from Moussa Traore's dictatorship to a multi-party system. The constitutional court scrapped the April 13 parliamentary poll, which launched the arid and impoverished nation's second multi-party elections, citing chaos and irregularities. The opposition wanted the whole election timetable revised but Konare, a historian elected in 1992, pressed ahead with only minor modifications and won the May 11 presidential election -- also boycotted by the main opposition. Turnout on April 13 was around 30 percent. On May 11, for Konare's reelection, it was just 28 percent. Mali won independence from France in 1960. It takes its name from a pre-colonial African empire that built its power on gold and flourished when Europe was in the Middle Ages. Gold remains a major source of foreign exchange, with Mali on course to become Africa's third largest producer. The vote in Mali followed Saturday's national elections in war-racked Liberia, where voters turned out in force for a poll designed to end seven years of civil war. Mali's poll will run to a second round on August 3. The 18-party radical opposition alliance includes supporters of Moussa Traore, who remains in detention, and of independence leader Modibo Keita, who ruled the poor and mainly Moslem nation as a pro-Soviet one-party socialist state. Konare's government has not formally banned protests. An independent electoral commission is running the election. Polls were to close at 6 p.m. (1800 GMT). First results were expected on Sunday night. Final results, to be ratified by the constitutional court, are likely within 72 hours.
MCAT	French bond and PIBOR futures ended a quiet session much higher on Tuesday, lifted by a return of domestic buyers to the market after Monday's consolidation. The franc strengthened significantly, moving from about 3.3863 per mark in early trading to 3.3805 per mark near the MATIF's close. Its strongest point for the day was 3.3795, reached shortly after 1400 GMT. Dealers said the softness in French markets on Monday was a correction they called healthy which would allow the market to make further gains in the days ahead once uncertainty about upcoming public sector strikes was put to rest.   French public workers will strike nationwide on Thursday in protest against government cutbacks and massive unemployment. But most analysts have said they do not expect the strike to widen or be extended to the size of last year's crippling public sector strike which nearly paralysed the country for three weeks last November and December. Dealers said once the strike ended, the fundamental outlook for French bond futures would remain positive and they expected the market to continue to perform strongly until U.S. debt markets changed their direction.
CCAT	Australia's largest cotton producer and trader, Colly Cotton Ltd, said on Tuesday it expected its share price to be re-rated after it released its annual results later this year. Colly Cotton Managing Director David Farley said Colly was currently trading at around seven times earnings when similar companies traded around 10 to 12 times earnings. "The stock should get a re-rating after we announce our annual results," Farley told reporters after an address to the Securities Institute of Australia.   Farley repeated earlier comments that he was very comfortable with Colly's prospectus forecast for net profit in the just completed year to June 30, 1997 of A$21.4 million. He would not elaborate further on if the profit would be above the A$21.4 million forecast, except to say he was "very, very confident of meeting prospectus forecasts." He said Colly's assets were currently valued at the drought-type valuation levels made before the 1992/93 drought broke. "If you revalued them today, which the company won't do, there's a substantial write-up in values," he said.   Farley said Colly's current yield of about 7.6 percent was attractive. "At A$1.30 it still looks good value." "It's only trading at seven times price/earnings now and comparable stocks are typically trading around 10 to 12 times, so we'd like to get a re-rating into that sort of area." Colly's shares were down five cents at A$1.25 by 3.55 p.m. (0555 GMT), having climbed from A$1.19 on July 8 to a year-high of A$1.30 in earlier trade on Tuesday against a weaker market overall.   Earlier, Farley said the group's water resources were assured for 1998 and that the group looked to three years of good profit growth. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
MCAT	Worldwide trading volume in emerging markets debt soared to $5.3 trillion in 1996 from $2.74 trillion in 1995, the Emerging Markets Trade Association (EMTA) said on Monday. Trading increased in all major debt instrument categories, according to the 113 respondents who participated in EMTA's annual survey. The overall volume of trade in Brady bonds rose 70 percent, but the Brady market's share fell to 50.7 percent in 1996 from 57.7 percent the year before.   Sovereign Eurobonds showed the largest increase in turnover, up 210 percent. Trading in options rose 163 percent; in corporate Eurobonds, 128 percent; and in local markets instrument trading, 108 percent. Loan assignments ended up 42 percent for the year, EMTA said. Latin American issues dominated the industry, with Brazilian assets remaining the most commonly traded instruments in 1996, accounting for $1.44 trillion, or 27.2 percent of total reported volume, the trade organization said.   Argentine assets were second, comprising 24.4 percent of total volume, followed by Mexican instruments, making up 17.9 percent, and Venezuelan assets, totaling 7.5 percent. Strong increases in traded volume were also reported in Russia and South Africa, registering gains of 162 percent to $380 billion and 308 percent to $170 billion respectively, EMTA said.   Trading in local markets instruments rose for the second year, making it the most commonly traded emerging markets category after Brady bonds. Local markets debt accounted for 22.4 percent of all trading in 1996, up from 20.9 percent in 1995. Reported turnover in Argentina's local Bocon bonds surged 361 percent to $263 billion, making the Bocons the third most commonly traded emerging market debt instrument, behind the $445 billion in turnover of Brazilian C bonds and $403 billion of Argentine FRBs.   Last year marked the first year in which the EMTA survey found the volume of a local markets instrument ranked comparably with top Brady bonds. In terms of market share, Eurobond trading rose to 12.4 percent of total volume from 8.5 percent in 1995, and options trading rose to 8.9 percent from 6.5 percent. Loan trading dipped to 4.7 percent of the total volume traded from 6.4 percent in 1995, largely because of the major Brady restructurings announced or completed in 1996, EMTA said. ((-- N.A.

CCAT	Rupert Murdoch's campaign for Chinese favour bore electronic fruit on Wednesday when a venture by his News Corp Ltd and China's People's Daily launched an online computer information service, company officials said. The ChinaByte Internet site would supply information technology news and data in Chinese to the growing army of Chinese users of the worldwide computer network, said officials of the joint venture, PDN Xinren Information Technology Co. The service was the first fruit of a $5.4 million 20-year joint venture between News Corp and the flagship Communist Party newspaper -- a 1995 venture seen as a key step in media baron Murdoch's attempts to penetrate China's news market. ChinaByte, with most of its $2.5 million investment from News Corp, would earn revenue mainly through advertising. It aimed to cut delays faced by Chinese Internet surfers trying to keep up with information technology changes via the English-dominated network, officials said. "What we want to do with ChinaByte... is put (Chinese users) back on an equal footing with their Western counterparts," PDN Xinren General Manager Bruce Dover told a news briefing. ChinaByte included an online database of computer companies in China and technology news and software licensed from U.S. computer magazine producer Ziff-Davis Publishing Co, which is owned by Japan's Softbank Corp, he said. The site, located at http://www.chinabyte.com, already had about 900 freely downloadable software programs accompanied by Chinese language reviews and ratings supplied by Ziff-Davis. The software made available would be carefully vetted to make sure it did not offend Chinese sensibilities, said Adam Power, managing director of Ziff-Davis Publishing Co (Asia). "You wouldn't see anything that is morally unacceptable on our sites," Power said. Analysts say getting along with China's often highly sensitive officials is a key part of News Corp's strategy for development in the potentially huge Chinese media market. Murdoch himself angered Beijing in 1993 when he said satellite television and telecommunications posed an "unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere", but he has since largely worked his way back into Chinese favour. In 1994, Murdoch complied with a public request from Beijing to stop broadcasting the British Broadcasting Corporation to China via his STAR TV satellite service and his Harper Collins unit agreed to publish the English version of a biography of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. The June 1995 creation of the PDN Xinren venture with a People's Daily subsidiary was seen as a vital step towards improving News Corp's image in China, although officials admitted it had taken longer than expected to start operations. "It took us a long time to set up this office," said Dover, adding that training staff and arranging Internet access had been the source of much of the delay. While the scale of Chinese Internet use was still unclear, PND Xinren expected rapid growth and was encouraged by increasing official acceptance of the network, he said. Blocks reported to have been placed by Beijing last year on international news Internet sites had been lifted, and even the People's Daily newspaper itself had entered cyberspace with a site at http://www.peopledaily.co.cn, he said. China was embracing the Internet, Dover said. "They are not trying to strangle it, as we thought for a while," he said.
GCAT	Rescue teams battled snow almost knee-deep on Tuesday searching for more victims of two earthquakes that killed nearly 1,000 people and displaced 36,000 in mountainous northwest Iran, Red Crescent officials said. "The search operation continues and we expect more casualties. The death toll is still 965 people, but we expect to dig out more bodies," a Red Crescent spokesman told Reuters. "The snow is making the job difficult and slow," he added. The official news agency IRNA said heavy snow start to fall on the rugged region bordering Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea on Monday night "seriously hampering relief operations". "The headquarters for dealing with natural disasters of Ardabil province announced on Tuesday that 30 centimetres (12 inches) has fallen in some areas, cutting off roads to some quake-stricken villages," it added. President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was to visit the devastated area on Tuesday to meet survivors and oversee relief work, Iranian newspapers said. Iran's Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati said most of the dead were killed in the first earthquake on Friday which measured 5.5 on the Richter scale. He said there had been no reports on casualties from another quake of 5.2 on the Richter scale which hit the region on Sunday night or from around 350 aftershocks since Friday. IRNA quoted him as saying release of the death toll from Friday's quake had been delayed because some people had buried relatives without registering them. Besharati said 2,600 people were injured and most had been released from hospitals. Those still in hospital were in satisfactory condition, he added. "Some 11,200 houses were destroyed in the quake... rehabilitation of the quake-stricken areas will start soon with the support of government and public assistance," he said. Iranian media had said units of the army and Revolutionary Guards joined about 5,000 relief workers already involved in rescue operations. The Red Crescent said on Monday more than 8,700 tents, 21,800 blankets, 15,300 heaters and lanterns, 2,000 cans of baby formula and 80 tonnes of bread had been distributed to victims. It said Switzerland, Britain, Japan and some international relief organisations had offered aid. Saudi Arabia announced on Monday it was sending two plane loads of relief supplies. Michael Schulenburg, U.N. resident coordinator in Tehran, told Reuters on Monday the United Nations was trying to mobilise international assistance, which Iran had said it would welcome. He said Iranian government coordinating committees and U.N. officials were meeting in Tehran on Tuesday to finalise a list of aid which should be made available by donors later in the day. Ardabil is an agricultural province inhabited mainly by Iran's Azeri minority. It is one of Iran's coldest regions with freezing temperatures during the winter. Earthquakes hit Iran regularly. The worst recorded one, measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale, killed 35,000 people near the Caspian coast in 1990.
CCAT	Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said on Monday that some operations of its Airbus Industrie A330-300 aircraft could resume by Tuesday after a 10-day suspension, following the arrival replacement parts. "It is feasible that operations could commence tomorrow -- we're not definitive on that yet -- but certainly soon thereafter," Cathay spokesman Charlie Stewart-Cox told Reuters. Cathay Pacific and its 25.5 percent owned Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Ltd (Dragonair) grounded their fleet of twin-engined A330-300 aircraft on May 24 after problems with Rolls-Royce Plc Trent 700 engines prompted a series of single-engine landings. Cathay has 11 of the aircraft and Dragonair has four. The suspension has caused the cancellation of more than 100 flights by Cathay Pacific. The problem stems from the lubrication system used in the Trent 700 gearbox, and Stewart-Cox said replacement modified parts had been approved by authorities in Britain and France. Stewart-Cox said the parts were arriving on Monday. Installation and testing would take place in Hong Kong and the airlines would be working with the territory's Civil Aviation Department, he said. "We would hope that all aircraft would be able to re-enter services during the week of (beginning) June 9," he said. Earlier on Monday, the airline listed 11 flights to be cancelled on Monday but said some of them would be combined with other flights. Charters have been arranged with Air Canada, Singapore Airlines Ltd, and Air Mauritius, it said. Cathay chairman Peter Sutch said on Saturday that the A330-300 fleet's grounding could slice between HK$120 million and HK$150 million (US$15.5 million to US$19.4 million) from the airline's bottom line this year.

ECAT	The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a plan to issue up to $1.8 billion of tax and revenue anticipation notes (TRANs) for fiscal 1997-1998. The note sale, which is expected to total $1.3 billion, would provide the county with the funds to meet its cash flow needs from July through December, the county said. Merrill Lynch & Co will act as lead manager for the note deal, which was approved by the county Board of Supervisors on a vote of 5-to-0 without discussion.   The county said the following firms would complete the financing team: Bank of America, Lehman Brothers, Smith Barney Inc, Artemis Capital Group Inc, Bear Stearns & Co, E.J. De La Rosa & Co Inc, Goldman Sachs & Co, M.R. Beal & Co, Morgan Stanley & Co, Redwood Securities Group Inc and Siebert Brandford Shank & Co. Depending on market conditions, Credit Suisse First Boston may provide a letter of credit, the county said. Pricing is expected in late June.
GCAT	Kent became the first county side to book a Benson and Hedges Cup quarter-final place as rain delayed several of their rivals on Monday. Kent, chasing 224 to beat British Universities, were under pressure on 99 for five before Gold Award winner Nigel Llong intervened with a match-winning 75 to ensure a four-wicket win. Essex also escaped the wet weather to move to the top of their group, captain Paul Prichard and Australian Stuart Law dishing out some heavy punishment to Somerset's bowlers. Set 270 to win, the home side romped home by eight wickets with 7.2 overs to spare, Law making 88 from 89 balls and Prichard cracking a career-best 114. Surrey look well-placed to qualify as well after a thumping 165-run victory over Hampshire at Southampton. The home side were bundled out for just 63 with Joey Benjamin taking four for 19. Elsewhere, Sussex kept their hopes of qualification alive with a 34-run success over Gloucestershire, but rain forced five other matches into a second day on Tuesday. Among the unfinished games was Ireland's visit to Wales to face Glamorgan in Cardiff. South African captain Hansie Cronje was unbeaten on 30 in his new side's 74 for three from 20.5 overs when play was finally halted for the day.
CCAT	Swedish truckmaker Scania said on Friday it has bought privately-owned Scania importer AS Estoscan as part of its strategy for growth in Estonia.   "The development of the market for heavy trucks in Estonia is positive. The turnaround to a market economy in Estonia has gone well, which influences the transport sector," said Scania marketing director Urban Erdtman. AS Estoscan has been Scania's importer since 1992 and has 34 employees. All employees will be offered positions in the new company. "Scania's purchase means the company will invest in service garages to strengthen our presence in the market," said Erdtman. In 1996 149 trucks were registered in Estonia and Scania has a 38 percent market share. -- Simon Haydon, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700-1004

GCAT	The Air Force on Tuesday ordered a delay in the adultery trial of its first woman bomber pilot until Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall can decide whether to accept the pilot's request for an honourable discharge from the service to end the case.   The court martial of 1st Lt. Kelly Flinn had been scheduled to begin at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota on Tuesday. She is charged with adultery, fraternisation and other violations of Air Force rules, including lying. But the Air Force said in a brief announcement from the Pentagon late on Tuesday that Flinn's request to quit the service under honourable circumstances was making its way through the chain of command to Widnall's office. "In order to provide the chain of command and the secretary with an opportunity to review and give due consideration to this matter, the request (by Air Force officials in Minot) to proceed to trial, including pre-trial sessions, has been denied," the statement said. Flinn, who is 26 and single, has acknowledged having an affair with a married civilian and also having sex with a lower-ranking enlisted man, violating the military code of conduct. She has also been charged with lying during an official investigation and failing to obey a direct order.
MCAT	U.S. West Coast spot electricity was trading steady Friday ahead of the Labor Day holiday weekend, although Palo Verde (PV) physicals were said to have moved higher with some marketers caught short at the Arizona trading point, industry sources said. "Last month for the most part everybody wanted to be long on PV, and that kept prices down, but this month (September) it seems to be just the opposite," said one Houston-based marketer. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) was said to have held over its Sunday price offer to the holiday Monday, with power priced at $13.00 and $15.00, depending on the time of day. For Tuesday, BPA was reportedly offering at $13.00, $16.00 and $18.00 per megawatt hour (MWh). At the California-Oregon Border (COB), prices for firm, peak next-day delivery were quoted at near $15.00 for weekend delivery and near $17.75 for Tuesday, from weekend power discussion at $14.00-17.00 on Thursday, the sources said. September COB power for firm, peak delivery was assessed steady at $17.75-18.00, the brokers and marketers said. October COB was seen holding in the $15.85-16.00 range. At the Mid-Columbia (Mid-C) delivery point in Washington, firm, peak electricity prices for the weekend were said to be holding steady near $15.00 per MWh.

GCAT	World athletics chief Primo Nebiolo attacked Athens on Monday for not promoting the world championships sufficiently after the stadium was only half full for Sunday's 100 metres finals, the event's biggest night. As Athens enters the final weeks of its campaign to host the 2004 Olympics, television pictures showing thousands of empty seats were broadcast around the world while American Maurice Greene was winning an exciting battle with Donovan Bailey for the men's 100 title. While Athens's old Olympic stadium was packed for Friday's opening ceremony while Vangelis played "Chariots of Fire" and dancers pretended to be athletes, the sight of real runners at the two opening days at the weekend has not had the same local appeal. "There has maybe not been a great campaign of promotion," said Nebiolo, the president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) who is also backing Rome's rival bid for the 2004 Games. "When we came around three weeks ago we understood that the promotion campaign was not being made. We tried to do it differently with the newspapers and TV." "Maybe because it was Saturday people in Athens go to the sea. I hope for the next few days that they will not go to the sea. They have the sea all year. They can forget the sea for one week." More than 53,000 seats in the Olympic stadium have been made available to the public. While the 1993 championships in Stuttgart and the 1995 championships in Gothenburg enjoyed bumper crowds, Athens has struggled. Nebiolo is in a difficult position diplomatically at these championships since Athens and Rome are regarded as being the two favourites to win the International Olympic Committee (IOC) vote to host the Games next month. The success or failure of these championships could be an important factor. The Greeks immediately countered the criticism by saying the nine-day programme was too long. "The programme is too big. Six days would have been better," Greek National Olympic Committee chief Lambis Nikolaou said. "More days is better for television and the advertising. "But there are too many days. Perhaps the prices are too high. At the Olympics there would be lower prices." Nebiolo said the IAAF had decided to take action against supporters of the Athens bid after scores of people held up a huge banner in the stadium on Saturday and Sunday. The IAAF does not allow advertising from any of the five cities bidding for the Games in the stadium. But spectators held up a banner with the official logo of the Athens bid which was clearly visible on television. "The flag is a clever initiative.  But it does not have a long life," Nebiolo said. "We have put people there to make sure it will not be allowed. In the next days you will not see any Athens and Rome are bidding against Cape Town, Buenos Aires and Stockholm to host the 2004 Games. The decision will be taken in Lausanne next month.
MCAT	Singapore shares mostly ended weaker on Monday, weighed down by a sell-off in Malaysian stocks traded over-the-counter following forex curbs imposed in Malaysia. "Malaysia is looking very weak and it is spilling over to Singapore shares. People are unwilling to commit because they don't think the situation has stablilised yet," a trader with a Singapore brokerage said. The UOB-OTC index plunged 2.18 percent or 23.61 points to end at a new year low of 1,061.15 in tandem with the fall in the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index. "There is no panic selling in the market going by the volume. Prices are just drifting down because there are no buyers out there," she said. But gains in selected key index stocks like Fraser & Neave, up 40 cents to S$10.50, and Robinson, up 35 cents to S$7.40, pulled the Straits Times Industrial Index higher at the close. The benchmark index climbed 8.35 points to end at 1,963.60. Total market volume was 144.22 million units with 331 loser beating 71 gainers. "There could be some trading opportunities in some blue chips with the fall in prices but most investors are going to stay sidelined and wait for more results first," a broker said. The half year corporate reporting season has just started and will continue well in to September. Among the most active were second liners like Chinese drug company Tianjin Zhongxin, which fell four cents to US$1.55, and Asia Food & Property, down 3.5 cents to US$0.89.
GCAT	Russian President Boris Yeltsin will stay in hospital for another three or four days while doctors carry out pre-surgical tests, the head of the presidential health centre said on Friday. "We have decided to prolong President Boris Yeltsin's stay in hopsital for another three or four days," Sergei Mironov told a news briefing.   Yeltsin, 65, went into Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital last weekend for a stay initially only expected to last over the weekend. But doctors have twice extended Yeltsin's stay in hospital, a different medical centre from the one where doctors are expected to operate on the president. Doctors say Yeltsin needs a coronary bypass operation to improve blood supply to his heart. The prolonged hospital stay has prompted widespread speculation that more is wrong with Yeltsin than doctors have admitted. The Kremlin points to occasional meetings with top officials as signs that the president's condition is not worsening.
CCAT	Philips Electronics NV's decision to relocate its audio manufacturing plant from Malaysia's Penang state to China should not be a cause for concern, chief minister of the northern island state said on Saturday. "The move was anticipated. In a way, we indirectly encourage such a move because the workers in the labour-intensive operations can then be retrained for more skill and technology intensive operations," Koh Tsu Koon was quoted by the national Bernama news agency as saying. Philips said on Friday its activities in Malaysia would be stopped in the first quarter of 1998, affecting around 1,500 jobs. The activities will move to Shenzhen in southern China. The company attributed its decision to relocate to the fact that Malaysia was moving towards becoming a fully industrialised nation and was fast replacing labour intensive operations with high-tech production centres. "We were informed (about the decision) a few weeks ago but we knew it was coming and we regard it as part of our climb in the technology ladder. "More labour-intensive production processes will slowly be phased out while we bring in more technology and capital intensive products," Koh said. He stressed that the relocation exercise will not affect the state's economy because many more factories are reinvesting on the island known as "Malaysia's Silicon Valley".
CCAT	Dutch soccer star Ruud Gullit is to have a range of casual clothing named after him under a five-year deal with UK sports and leisurewear firm Hay & Robertson, the company said on Friday. Gullit, player-manager of Chelsea, will be paid an initial six-figure sum and also receive a royalty on worldwide sales of the items. The company plans to produce a wide range of leisure clothing from tops to underwear which it will market under the "Ruud" label of its Admiral brand. "We're delighted that we have attracted such a high profile figure," said Hay & Robertson chief executive Lance Yates.   "He's stylish, a great role model and very eloquent. We've had a succession of development meetings and he's had a lot of input and will work with us on developing the range," he added. Yates said he believed the clothing would appeal to everyone from teenagers to 40-year-olds. The dreadlocked Gullit has been one of the most popular and successful players in world soccer over the past decade in a career which has taken him from his native Netherlands to Italy and then on to England. Hay & Robertson recently paid 150,000 stg to acquire the European licensing rights to the Admiral brand.   It is seeking to relaunch Admiral, which dominated the British soccer kit market in the 1970s, but now supplies only a handful of lower division clubs. -- Keith Weir, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8793

CCAT	Adidas AG Chief Executive Robert Louis-Dreyfus said on Wednesday he did not plan to step down and join the German sportswear maker's supervisory board in 1998 as he had earlier planned. Louis-Dreyfus, who has engineered the turnaround of Adidas after leading a group of international investors that bought the once-troubled group in the mid-1990s, said he would like to remain on the management board through the turn of the century. "I would like to be on the management board in 2000 if the shareholders don't sack me," Louis-Dreyfus said at the group's annual shareholder meeting. Louis-Dreyfus had said at news conferences when Adidas was publicly floated in November 1995 that he would step down and join the supervisory board after the 1998 soccer World Cup. The decision by Louis-Dreyfus marked another of his steps to express his commitment to Adidas. He and his partners recently cashed in on their investment in adidas by selling off a major stake of their shareholdings in the Herzogenaurach-based group through Sogedim SA, a Belgian-based corporation. The investors in April offered 11.8 million shares, or 26.1 percent of the total share capital of Adidas, to institutional investors around the world and retail investors in Germany. Louis-Dreyfus and Adidas board member Christian Tourres then each repurchased 2.95 million shares in the offering and now each directly owns 6.6 percent of adidas. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
CCAT	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp, Taiwan's top chipmaker, said on Wednesday its fourth wafer fabrication plant would start production in February. The new plant, which will make chips based on eight-inch wafers, was expected to attain T$4 billion in revenues for the company in 1997, Taiwan Semiconductor said in a statement. Taiwan Semiconductor started building the factory in 1995. The high-tech plant should reach output of 22,000 eight-inch wafers a month by the end of 1997 and hit full capacity of 30,000 wafers a month by the end of 1998, it said. -- Taipei Newsroom (2-5080815)
MCAT	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange plans to begin trading next year in MATIF 10-year French bond contracts and LIFFE short-term interest rate contracts. "We're not waiting until 1999," CME president William Brodsky said in an interview. "You'll see this trading in 1997. I just can't give you a specific date." The Marche a Terme International de France and the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange said Wednesday they had signed linkage agreements with the CME.   The agreements pave the way for the CME to tap into the euro market if and when the European Monetary Union (EMU) is established in 1999. "Their (MATIF) Notionnel is a very strong market," Brodsky said. "They are the only market for their government debt and we will just be their partners on the side." On Tuesday, the Chicago Board of Trade said its linkage with LIFFE, which will begin in May 1997 with LIFFE's German Bunds and the CBOT's U.S. Treasury debt complex, would include LIFFE's long-term euro-denominated debt contracts in 1999.   Under separate agreements, the CME would trade the MATIF's 10-year French franc bond futures and options contracts and LIFFE's short-term interest rate products during part of the CME's open outcry sessions. Brodsky said MATIF and LIFFE contracts traded at the CME would be cleared at their respective exchanges, not at the CME. He also said the home exchanges' commission fee would apply to the transactions no matter where the contract was traded. -Derivatives desk 312-408-8750;E-mail derivatives@reuters.com
CCAT	Avista Advantage expects to be profitable this year on revenues of $6 million, President Gerry D. Crooks said Tuesday. Revenues are expected to be in the $20 to $30 million range in three to four years, he told Reuters. Crooks was in New York with other Washington Water Power Co officials for presentations to security analysts. Avista, which changed its name Monday, has been doing business for 15 months.   He attributed the company's ability to show profits at this stage of development to its "significantly different" approach to the energy services business. With its proprietary billing program, which allows Avista to provide customers with a single monthly energy bill, the company is able to provide customers with "immediate benefits," Crooks said. He said the company's latest contract is with the U.S. Postal Service for a pilot resource accounting program at its 23 Portland, Ore., facilities.   Initially, "we'll be giving them a handle on their Portland facilities," he said, noting the effort will be monitored by national Postal Service officials for possible expansion. Avista looks at itself as a commodity manager rather than a commodity provider, Washington Water corporate and investor relations administrator Patrick M. Lynch said. He pointed out the company can provide the commodities too, if the customer wants, through Avista Energy, the trading and marketing arm of Avista Advantage's parent, Avista Corp.   He noted fuel commodities are part of the full service that Avista is providing California's SharePlus Hospital Association. Crooks said the services provided White Lodging include a determination of per room energy costs. He said other customers include Tidyman's, a regional grocery chain, and 35 western U.S. and British Columbia plants operated by Louisiana-Pacific Corp.  Noting the timber company has contracts with four energy service providers covering its operations in various areas, Crooks said he believes "they ultimately will go to one of the four." The company has made 200 proposals to U.S. and Canadian companies, he noted. ((-- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610.))

GCAT	Germany's Alexander Cejka produced a stunning back-nine to catch title holder Padraig Harrington of Ireland for a share of a one-shot lead after the Spanish Open first round on Thursday. Cejka collected six birdies in seven holes from the 11th to haul up alongside Harrington at La Moreleja, the Irishman having won last year at the Club de Campo course. Their rounds of six-under-par 66 (corrects scores) were one better than two Englishman, Ryder Cup international Mark James and one of the few club professionals on the European Tour, Gary Emerson. Argentina's Eduardo Romero, Dane Thomas Bjorn and Stephen Ames of Trinidad and Tobago were among a group on four-under-par in fifth place. Guesting Australian Greg Norman and comeback Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal kept in touch with the lead with rounds of 69. Severiano Ballesteros gave himself the chance of making his first cut of the year, despite late bogeys, when he posted a 70 to be four off the pace. Cejka has been in a trough since winning three times in 1995, including the prestigious final event of that year's European Tour season, the Volvo Masters. But like recently-crowned U.S. Masters champion Tiger Woods, he has found inspiration from shortening his backswing. Cejka, born in Czechoslovakia but taking out German citizenship after fleeing to his adopted country with his father when nine, said: "I've shortened my backswing, like Tiger Woods, although I started changing well before his Masters win. "And there are two or three little things I've been working on, like taking it a little bit more on the inside. "One day it's worked, another it hasn't and today it did.

MCAT	Madrid shares were higher at midday on Monday, with a surging peseta and buyers of key blue chips bolstering the indices. Turnover was boosted by a heavy flow of put through orders. The general index rose 4.22 points, 0.68 percent, to 627.39 and the Ibex rose 51.97 points, 0.73 percent, to 7,164.49. Repsol was at the forefront of trade, recovering from a bout of weakness linked to uncertainty overhanging Gas Natural's new tariffs, traders said, which now seemed to be diminishing. Repsol added 100 pesetas to 6,450 pesetas, while Gas Natural was up 450 pesetas to 32,150. Dealers predicted substantial upside for both shares.   Clear resistance for the Ibex is pegged at 7,200, but the Dow's performance will call the tune, dealers said. "It all depends on Wall Street...but as we enter the summer months we're seeing a lot of domestic demand with not a lot of foreign acitivity. We could hit 7,200, but to me it feels a bit thin up there," said one dealer at Societe Generale. As regards Repsol, some negative feeling still prevails but the stock is due to gain now after lagging the market, dealers said. Also in the limelight was Asturiana, up 210 pesetas to 3,225 after resuming trade following a suspension last week. Glencore has offered to buy another 20 percent at 3,400 pesetas/share.
CCAT	Chrysler Corp. said on Friday its profits plunged in the second quarter as the No. 3 U.S. automaker took a $438 million after-tax charge related to a 29-day strike at a Detroit engine plant. The strike at the Mound Road plant in April and May temporarily shut down seven of Chrysler's assembly plants. "The second quarter was a very difficult one for Chrysler," said Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton. "Our results were significantly affected by the UAW strike -- our vehicle shipments were reduced by an estimated 89,000 units." Including the charge, which totalled $730 million before taxes, Chrysler earned $483 million, or 70 cents per common share, in the second quarter. The company earned $1.03 billion, or $1.39 per share, in the year-ago period, when it took an after-tax gain of $87 million for the sale of Electrospace Systems, Inc., and Chrysler Technologies Airborne Systems, Inc. It also posted a $100 million after-tax charge to write down Thrifty Rent-A-Car System, Inc. Pretax earnings for the second quarter fell to $811 million from $1.72 billion for the 1996 period. "While the general economy and consumer confidence continue to look good, increased competition and softer sales have forced us to increase incentives and step up our ongoing efforts to eliminate waste and reduce expenses," Eaton said. "We've taken prudent steps by initiating a temporary freeze on outside hiring, reducing overtime and travel and delaying some discretionary capital spending projects." A Chrysler spokesman said the capital spending reductions will not affect any of the Auburn Hills, Mich.-based automaker's future car and truck programmes. Chrysler's average U.S. retail incentive in the second quarter jumped to $980 per vehicle from $625 a year ago and $705 in the first quarter. Chrysler said its combined U.S. and Canadian market share in the second quarter fell to 15.5 percent from 16.7 percent a year ago and 15.6 percent in the first quarter. After-tax profit per vehicle during the second quarter fell to $515 from $1,180 a year earlier, after taking into account the effect of the engine plant strike. Excluding the strike's impact, Chrysler's profit per vehicle was $989 in the second quarter. However, Chrysler said its momentum appears to be rebuilding, as it had its best June ever for light truck sales. General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are due to report earnings July 16. Chrysler's stock rose 25 cents to $35 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was among the most active issues at mid-morning.

GCAT	Cuba's ruling Communist Party said on Wednesday it was in favour of greater internal democracy but it should not threaten national unity and democratic centralism would remain its guiding principle. The Cuban party said in an analysis published in the party newspaper Granma that it would not renounce "the principle of Democratic Centralism," which is traditionally an ideological pillar of Communist Party states. This was a clear message that the leadership remained committed, despite increasing foreign pressure, to preserving its existing one-party political system. But the document said this commitment did not contradict the need for "an ever greater democracy within the body of the party." It defined this as "all the space necessary for the expression of ideas, proposals, opinions, whether they coincide or disagree, about any issue, however polemic or complicated." But the document, which was being published in daily instalments by Granma, went on to say that there could be no room for "tendencies which weaken the discipline and political activity of the party." It added that this encouragement of internal democracy "cannot be allowed to threaten the essential unity of our existence as an independent nation." The need for unity in the face of external hostility, particularly from Cuba's ideological enemy the United States, was one of the arguments regularly used by President Fidel Castro to explain why his government continued to reject the idea of Western-style multi-party democracy. Cuban authorities, invoking the island's constitution and laws, which defend the existence of a one-party state, treat internal political opposition groups as illegal and often persecute their members, accusing them of being "counter-revolutionaries" in the service of the United States. The Cuban government last week revoked the visa of a U.S. diplomat at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, accusing her of actively supporting and organising Cuban dissident groups. Washington denied this and expelled a Cuban diplomat in reply. The analysis document said the aim of U.S. policy was still the destruction of the "Cuban Revolution" -- official Cuban shorthand for the island's one-party socialist system. It also said religious values, when honestly put into practice, were good for the country and its people. This reflected a policy of greater tolerance toward religion adopted by the ruling party in recent years, a contrast to the overt hostility and suspicion that marked church-state relations immediately after the 1959 revolution.

ECAT	The Canadian government has listed trade concessions it said it would be seeking from its trading partners over the coming year. The goals, set out by International Trade Minister Art Eggleton in a report entitled "Canada's International Market Access Priorities - 1997," ranged from elimination of certain European tariffs to better telecoms access in India. For the United States, its biggest partner, it listed mainly the concept of defending Canadian cultural policies in the face of U.S. challenges. Canada subsidizes and protects its cultural industry, to the anger especially of Washington. The report said Canada would seek improved access in Mexico in farm products, trucking, telecommunications, financial services and government procurement. For the European Union, it will seek the elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers on products such as fur, cereals, asbestos and aluminum. It will urge Japan to modify a range of measures affecting, primarily, Canadian exports of agri-food products and building products and housing. In South Korea it will seek improved access in telecommunications products, agri-food and beverage products and investment. It will seek improved access to the Indian market in areas such as telecommunications and through the phase-out of balance-of-payments import restrictions. It said it would "look forward to continued, excellent access to the Hong Kong market" after it reverts to Chinese rule on July 1.
GCAT	A top Republican senator asserted on Sunday that the Clinton administration knew China was trying to buy political influence illegally a year before the 1996 presidential election. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating the affair, said on CBS "Face the Nation" that despite this knowledge, the Democrats relied on fund-raisers with ties to China. (Corrects Hatch's position on committee to a member, from chairman). Hatch said that the FBI had warned the State Department, CIA, Justice Department, two Congressional committees and as many as seven lawmakers as early as 1995 of China's intentions to make illegal campaign contributions. That was a year before the Federal Bureau of Investigation told National Security Council staffers at the White House in June 1996 -- a warning that President Bill Clinton said last week he never received and which led to an unusual flare up with the FBI. Hatch suggested that the 1996 FBI warning to the NSC staff was never passed on to Clinton because so many people in the administration were already aware of it. "They knew that the Chinese government was going to come into this country in an attempt to purchase influence," Hatch said on the television show. "I can't blame the Chinese government in any effort that's legitimate to try and get Most Favoured Nation status or even into the World Trade Organisation, but where you have to find fault is this knowledge that they were going to spend upwards of $2 million illegally through laundered funds to influence the election," Hatch said. He also criticised Democrats for relying on questionable fund-raisers with Asian connections, notably John Huang, when there were clear warnings from the FBI that the Chinese were attempting to buy influence. "I hope this is not as serious as it appears," he said, "but look, there are just too many things going on here that may reach the highest levels of the White House and the DNC, and that being the case, that's why you've got to have an independent counsel." Many Republicans have called on Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint an independent counsel to investigate the White House fund-raising affair, saying that her department has a conflict of interest in undertaking the probe because she is appointed by the president.

MCAT	Danish bond prices fell on Thursday echoing German declines and expected to continue down. "The correction on the German market has been rather exaggerated in my opinion but we are following suit nonetheless with business good," one dealer said. The benchmark eight percent state bond due 2006 was down 0.17 point from the opening or 0.63 point lower than Wednesday's close at 110.47 in 3.8 billion crown turnover. The forthcoming seven percent 2007 benchmark was 0.18 point down from the start or 0.69 point down from Wednesday's close at 102.98 in 2.5 billion crown turnover.

GCAT	Canadian businessman Maurice Strong on Thursday was named as senior advisor to Secretary-General Kofi Annan at a nominal $1 a year salary. U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Strong, currently an advisor at the World Bank in Washington, would help Annan "coordinate efforts to redesign the organisation for the future." Strong is expected to head a staff of about three people. He served in a similar but less structured consulting role on reform to Annan's predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Annan intends in the first six months of his term to come up with a plan for restructuring the world body, under intense criticism from the United States for duplication and waste. But since most of the programmes and special agencies and commissions are mandated by the General Assembly, he has to have agreement of all U.N. members before major reform can be instituted. Strong, a former Calgary oil executive, served as U.N. undersecretary-general for the Earth Summit conference on the environment in 1992. He is one of a small number of senior staff and advisers who work for nominal salaries.
GCAT	Bosnian Croat refugees have expelled and abused elderly Serbs in central Croatia, threatening them with bombs and smashing windows, Serbs and human rights monitors said on Thursday. Milorad Pupovac, a Serb civic leader and member of the Croatian parliament, said more than 100 men attacked three villages in the Banovina region south of Zagreb on Tuesday night, "beating the villagers and destroying their property". Some Serbs were beaten by the Bosnian Croats, who included men in military uniform, added Ivan Cicak, who heads human rights monitoring group Helsinki Watch in Croatia. Lovre Pejkovic, head of the government office for displaced persons, said problems started when eight to 10 Serbs, who fled the village of Bijelovac in 1995, returned there on Tuesday wihtout notifying the police or the municipal authorities. "We don't want to prevent the return of Serbs but there must be a legal procedure," Pejkovic told Reuters in the nearby municipal town of Kostajnica on Thursday. Milan Veljaca, 69, said a group of men he could not identify threw stones at his house in Umetici, another Serb village, while he and his wife were asleep. "One of them shouted 'Come out or I'll throw a bomb'," he told Reuters. "One guy hit me in the head with a hammer and slapped me. Another stripped my wife's clothes from her," he said, standing by the shattered windows of his house. "They shouted: 'What are you waiting for? This is not Serbian land, this is Croatian.'" Veljaca, who had a bandage around his head and cuts on his leg, returned to his village from Serbia in January. He and his wife were taken to a hospital by ambulance. A police inspector said about 100 houses were attacked. "It always happens after dark," he added. Before the 1991-95 wars in Croatia and Bosnia, about two-thirds of the population in the area was Serb, the rest Croat. Kostajnica police chief Zeljko Bolcevic told Reuters that three Croats had been arrested but later released as the incident qualified only as a misdemeanour. "There were individual cases of verbal abuse and quarrels with the local Serb population. But there was no organised expulsion," he said. "Some (Serbs) left in fear, but that was not necessary, we would have protected them as we have done so far." About a thousand ethnic Croats expelled from Bosnia by Serb troops and resettled by the Croatian government in former Serb houses around Kostajnica protested on Thursday against the return of original Serb residents. Marko Matic, a 23-year-old Croat from Posavina in northern Bosnia, lost a kidney after being badly beaten by Serbs in 1991 and said he would never live alongside Serbs. "Some came back from Serbia -- Serbs, chetniks (ultra-nationalists), animals who killed our people. They said 20,000 Serbs will come back," he said. "Are we here only to clean the houses for the Serbs so they can move back in?" He was referring to Croatian government plans to orchestrate a mass resettlement of displaced people, moving Serbs out of Eastern Slavonia to their pre-war homes, to allow Croats to return. Eastern Slavonia enclave is now administered by the United Nations under a mandate expiring on July 15. It will then become part of Croatia proper and revert to Zagreb's control. "This one incident encapsulates some of the larger problems we have," said Phil Arnold, U.N. spokesman in the enclave. "Every activity like this slows down the return of Croatian displaced persons into Eastern Slavonia," he told Reuters. The United States, which Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic is now visiting, voiced concern over Croatia's attitude to the issue. "We support the right of refugees and displaced persons to return to their homes...from which they were driven during the war, and we are concerned that Croatia has not taken the steps necessary to facilitate the return of the ethnic Serb refugees to Croatia," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.

CCAT	Indonesia's PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna said it posted total cigarette sales of 1.14 trillion rupiah in the first six months of 1997 against 961.66 billion rupiah in the same period of 1996.   Sampoerna said in a statement received on Thursday that the firm sold 10.77 billion cigarette sticks in the first half of 1997 against 10.48 billion sticks in the year-ago period. It said the 1996 street price increases for its popular brands Dji Sam Soe (DSS) and A-Mild have continued to have repercussions on sales. DSS sales volume growth was flat, while A-Mild sales volume fell by 1.66 percent year-on-year, the firm said.   Sampoerna said sales volume of its Sampoerna A Hijau brand rose 73 percent year-on-year, Dji Sam Soe Filter was up 66 percent and its recently launched A-International had received a strong response. But is said sales were below internal projections. "With DSS at two percent and A-Mild at 13 percent below respective projections for volume and value, aggregate sales performance has fallen below annual projections for volume by 6.6 percent and for value by five percent," the firm said. Sampoerna did not give further details. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364
GCAT	Marxist rebels released a sick- looking Japanese captive on Christmas Day, keeping 104 prisoners under their guns as the Peruvian hostage crisis neared the end of its eighth day. His head slumped to one side, the hostage was pushed out of the besieged Japanese embassy residence by Red Cross workers and put into a police ambulance that sped him away. Japanese officials named the man as Kenji Hirata, 34, and said he was a first secretary at their embassy in Lima. Red Cross spokesman Steven Anderson said Hirata "left because he was in a delicate condition." He said he had no more specific information. Hirata left the residence just after 5 P.M. (2200 GMT) along with Roman Catholic Bishop Jose Luis Cipriani, who spent seven hours inside celebrating a Christmas Day Mass for the mainly Christian captives. Cipriani, famous in Peru for his outspoken denunciations of guerrilla violence and human rights violations, left without speaking to reporters, but local radio said he had heard confessions from the hostages. Earlier in the day, President Alberto Fujimori's daughter Keiko appealed for the release of the VIP prisoners from the besieged Japanese embassy residence after supervising the delivery of a Christmas lunch sent by Peru's first family. "I would like to make an appeal to the MRTA (rebels) to lay down their arms," she told reporters before speeding off in her bulletproof Mercedes limousine. But as the siege neared the start of a ninth day, there was no sign of a concession by the roughly 20 heavily armed rebels of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). Tension eased briefly as presidential palace chefs delivered the seasonal feast of turkeys richly decorated with fruit. Red Cross helpers unloaded the meal onto trolleys that they wheeled up to the grand front portal of the residence. "Thank-you brothers. Happy Christmas," the hostages replied minutes later in a handwritten sign held up to a residence window. Red Cross officials described the captives' health as good and said the delivery of fresh water and new supplies of medicine eased the risk of new cases of the diarrhoea and eye infection that some hostages had last week. Outside, in the streets, a choir sang Yuletide carols to the captives. Lima's normal misty gray clouds gave way to bright sunshine. For the first time, the besieged residence became a tourist attraction. Visitors, who included flight attendants, turned up to gawk at the hordes of news people and police at the scene. Prostitutes and street hawkers worked the nearby streets. Hirata's release brought to two the number of hostages set free in the last three days. The other freed captive was Uruguayan Ambassador Tabare Bocalandro, liberated on Tuesday after his government released two MRTA guerrillas from jail. Furious at the apparent concession, the Peruvian government pulled out its top diplomat in Uruguay. Local media recalled bitterly that Uruguay had signed a declaration by Latin American nations vowing not to give in to terrorist demands. Fujimori has flatly rejected all the demands made by the guerrillas and has said they must release the captives and hand over their weapons. The rebels have said they will not surrender until the government releases more than 400 MRTA members from Peruvian jails. They also want an end to free-market economic policies and more state support for the country's impoverished majority. Japanese media covering the crisis speculated that a behind-the-scenes deal might be worked out to allow the MRTA captors to fly to asylum in Cuba after releasing the hostages, but there has been no official word on this scenario. Japan has around 30 nationals inside the besieged residence, including Tokyo's Ambassador Morihisa Aoki, host of the ill-fated cocktail reception on Dec. 17 that was stormed by the MRTA rebels. Always tight-lipped with the press, Fujimori has closeted himself with generals and top advisers and cut himself off from the media during the crisis. Presidential officials have given no information to the hordes of waiting journalists.

GCAT	Israeli police said on Saturday they were investigating the killing of a Palestinian accused of selling land to Jews, an activity the Palestinian Authority has said is punishable by death. Police spokesman Shmulik Ben-Ruby said Palestinian security forces on Saturday handed the body of East Jerusalem land dealer Farid Bashiti to Israeli authorities for forensic tests. Bashiti, 70, was found dead in PLO-ruled Ramallah on Friday. Palestinian security sources said Bashiti was discovered bound and with signs of a blow to the head. Family members said Bashiti's skull was fractured. "He was a collaborator and a dealer of lands who used to sell lands to Israelis," a Palestinian security official who refused to be identified told Reuters. The Palestinian Authority said this week it would apply the death sentence to Palestinians or their agents who sold land to Israelis in order to halt expansion of Jewish settlement on lands Israel seized in 1967. Israeli security sources accused Palestinian security forces of luring Bashiti to an East Jerusalem hotel and kidnapping him. "We are investigating two possibilites - that he was killed for selling land to Jews and because of a dispute," police spokesman Shmulik Ben-Ruby told Reuters. Bashiti's family did not assign blame for the killing. "My lost father is an innocent victim which could be resulting from a property personal conflict translated into a national issue," Bashiti's son Mohammed Bashiti told reporters. The PLO-appointed Mufti of Jerusalem, the city's top Moslem cleric, said Bashiti fell under a 70-year old religious ruling barring Moslems who sold land to Jews from being buried in a Moslem graveyard. "I have called on Moslems to treat the man involved in this way. They should not bury him or pray at his grave," Mufti Ikrima Sabri told Reuters. Palestinian security sources and Palestinian Authority officials denied any connection to Bashiti's killing. But Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu Meddein said any Arab who sold to Jews lands Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war was a "traitor" deserving "severe" punishment. "As I have said before, expect the unexpected for these matters because nobody from this moment will accept any traitor who sells his land to Israelis," Abu Meddein told Reuters. "Our official position is that we have to send everybody by charge sheet to military court or normal court but actually we have to punish him very strongly, very severely," Abu Meddein said. "Everybody now realises the danger of selling land to a Jew."

At 1000 hrs on Dec 10 it will release the October estimates for wholesale trade.
MCAT	German shares closed bourse dealings lower on Wednesday as players took profit following record highs reached during Tuesday. Although the dollar came back from levels reached in early European trade, it held above the critical 1.54 mark level, supporting German exporting sectors, particularly chemicals and autos. Dealers also said the market was on hold before U.S. September consumer price data due after the bourse trade, which could contain some indications about the future direction of U.S. interest rates. The DAX index of Germany's 30 leading shares ended down 13.55 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,714.90, retreating from the record high of 2,728.64 reached briefly on Tuesday. The IBIS DAX, which records all-day computerised trade in the DAX, was off just 0.35 points at 2,718.38. Profits had already been taken on IBIS on Tuesday afternoon. "We could be ready for a bit of a pause at the moment. But even if it goes down one percent, it's not really serious," one trader said. The consensus forecast for U.S. September consumer price data, due at 1230 GMT, is for a rise of around 0.3 percentage points. But dealers said they were not expecting market reaction to the figures to be large either way. Among individual shares, car-maker Volkswagen AG rose 6.45 marks to end bourse dealings at 590.20 as dealers said it benefitted from positive sentiment surrounding the sector after U.S.-based General Motors' rise in third-quarter profits announced on Tuesday.
GCAT	NATO, countering Bosnian Serb allegations, said on Saturday that peacekeeping soldiers did not abuse the Red Cross symbol when they arrested a suspected war criminal in a Bosnian hospital. The NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR) acknowledged for the first time that British soldiers had carried a parcel bearing a Red Cross label when they arrived at a hospital in Prijedor to detain Milan Kovacevic, an indicted war criminal. The soldiers announced they were making "a delivery for Kovacevic" but at no point alluded to the marking on the parcel, SFOR said in a statement issued in Sarajevo. "SFOR soldiers who gained access to Prijedor hospital did not do so in disguise or by subterfuge. They were dressed and armed as SFOR soldiers," the statement said. The parcel had a hand-sized Red Cross label but did not bear the symbol of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), it said. NATO issued the statement in response to allegations from the head of the Bosnian Serb Red Cross, Ljiljana Karadzic, wife of the Serb political leader and indicted war criminal, Radovan Karadzic. Mrs Karadzic accused SFOR of using the Red Cross symbol as a ruse to gain entry to the hospital, calling the operation a "dishonest act". She demanded the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) investigate the matter. The Geneva-based humanitarian organisation, which helps victims of war, noted the divergent account of events from SFOR and from Mrs Karadzic, and said it remained committed to operating as an impartial organisation. "The ICRC expresses its immediate concern about these allegations regarding the use of the Red Cross emblem," the organisation said on Friday. SFOR officers said the arrest of Kovacevic was conducted professionally and without incident. He was later extradited to the Netherlands to face trial before the U.N. war crimes tribunal. A second suspect, former Prijedor police chief Simo Drljaca, was shot dead when he opened fire on soldiers trying to detain him. Both men were charged with participating in a genocidal campaign against Moslems and Croats in the Prijedor region early in the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
ECAT	Australian Treasurer Peter Costello on Monday pressed state and territory governments to quickly resolve problems over taxes on tobacco, alcohol and petrol. Costello refused to rule out abandoning a national government plan to raise the A$5 billion taxes on behalf of the states if they failed to guarantee prices would not increase.   "If the states are able to put in place the refund mechanisms which they assured the Commonwealth (national government) they would, it should be resolved today," Costello told reporters. The national government agreed last week to levy the taxes itself and return the money to the six states and two territories after the High Court ruled the provincial governments had no powers to raise such taxes. Costello was asked if Canberra could abandon its plan.   "The Commonwealth, at the request of the states, has been asked to put in place an arrangement on the assurance that prices won't go up," he said. "If prices go up, we will consider that a failure by the states to put in place the refund mechanisms," he said. "They're having a meeting today to try and sought it out. Let's hope that they do so. But as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, we only acted on the assurance that they would put in place the refund mechanisms to hold prices."   Some state governments are embroiled in a row with the industries over whether some of the now outlawed taxes have been paid in advance and how the new taxes will be applied and refunds given to ensure prices remain steady. Under the constitution, Canberra must charge the same rate of tax in all states. But the taxes overturned by the court varied from state to state. The national government will levy its taxes at the highest state rate, with the low-tax states providing refunds. -- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730
GCAT	Zaire rebel leader Laurent Kabila said on Friday he would invite the United Nations and aid agencies to investigate the crisis over Rwandan refugees in rebel areas. Kabila, head of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), told Reuters the world body and its Secretary-General Kofi Annan had blown the issue "completely out of proportion". Kabila again repeated denials his forces had slaughtered Rwandan Hutu refugees at a camp south of the eastern provincial capital of Kisangani but said he would accept independent findings and where necessary take action against his troops. "I seek nothing but the truth about the refugee crisis in Kisangani. I will immediately be asking the United Nations and aid agencies to set up an independent probe team on the saga," he said. "I will accept independent findings and if there is reason to take action against my troops, I will happily do so. But facts before me suggest my troops only intervened to stop fighting between armed refugees and local Zaireans." Kabila said he would also allow the U.N., aid agencies and western diplomats to reach the refugees outside Kisangani. "They must all be allowed free access to the refugees so they can draw their own conclusions. I have nothing to hide," he said. Kabila said he also wanted the United Nations to tell him whether it had changed its convention on refugees to allow them to carry firearms and arms. Hutu former Rwandan troops and militiamen were among refugees fleeing the advancing rebels. "There is a very, very big heavily armed group among the refugees and it is these people who are causing trouble, holding others to ransom and yet are still classified as refugees by the United Nations," the rebel leader said. Kabila, whose forces now control more than half of Africa's third largest country, said his forces were consolidating their push towards Zaire's capital Kinshasa. Annan on Thursday strongly criticised Kabila on the refugee crisis but the rebel chief said he had asked governments including Zambia, Uganda, Rwanda and South Africa to explain the situation to the U.N. secretary-general "in its proper context". "He (Annan) must come and see the multiple problems created by the armed Rwandans described as refugees. He must also address the problem once and for all. We are prepared to facilitate the movement of genuine refugees back home," he said. Zairean villagers said on Wednesday that Kabila's rebels slaughtered hundreds of Rwandan Hutu refugees at a camp south of Kisangani on Tuesday in revenge for the killing of six Zaireans. Rebels say they intervened to stop fighting after villagers attacked Kasese camp, 25 km (15 miles) south of Kisangani. The refugees fled Rwanda in 1994 and are collectively accused by minority Tutsis of genocide in Rwanda the same year. They arrived at Kasese camp near Kisangani in mid-March after six months of trekking over volcanic rock and through bush and jungle in a vain attempt to flee Kabila's rebels. Kabila bowed to international pressure on April 5 and agreed to an airlift to repatriate the 100,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees at Kasese and further south. But the airlift has failed to start.

CCAT	Mobile phone and pager users in Singapore experienced an unusual silence on Saturday when networks broke down across the island, state television said. A mobile phone in the hand or a pager on the belt is almost as common as a watch on the wrist in this affluent city state. State television gave a figure of some 1.2 million pager or mobile phone subscribers. Singapore's total population is 3 million. State television quoted Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (SingTel) as saying there seemed to be congestion at the connection between its fixed line and mobile and paging networks, and that a software fault was affecting a key switch. Problems began around midday and were still continuing as of late evening. State television reported its hotline received calls from a number of irate subscriber and pager users complaining about the situation. The Telecommunications Authority of Singapore has asked SingTel to investigate and report on the cause of the problem, state television said.
MCAT	Israeli shares closed higher on Tuesday led by a rise in medium- and small-capitalisation stocks, traders said. The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares rose 0.45 percent, or 0.94 points, to 211.03 on all-share turnover of 100 million shekels against 98 million shekels on Monday. The Maof 25 blue-chip index gained 0.35 percent to 219.36. "The session opened with nice gains on the Maof, but Maof options speculators pushed the market downwards," said Doron Tsur, head of research at Sahar Securities. "Most activity continues to be concentrated in the medium- and small-capitalisation stocks," Tsur said. "There is a general consensus that the small-cap stocks (traded on the Caram) are very cheap despite the recent rally." Overall, he said, the market had risen very fast during the last few weeks and investors were now a little jittery. "Bonds yields have been falling and new money is coming into the stock market. But after the recent rise we are waiting for a correction. Such a correction has to come before the market can rise any further," said a trader at Bank Leumi. Traders said the 0.5 percentage point cut in interest rates to 14.7 percent, announced by the Bank of Israel after trading on Monday, had no impact on the market as the reduction was within expectations. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the most active share, gained 1.0 percent to 148,395 on volume of 5.4 million shekels. On Monday Teva said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had granted marketing clearance for Copaxone, Teva's multiple sclerosis treatment. American Israeli Paper Mills surged 5.25 percent to 13,306, which traders attributed to the recent rise in paper prices. Other active shares included Koor Industries, which gained 1.0 percent to 28,639 on turnover of 4.9 million shekels, and Bank Hapoalim, which fell 0.5 percent to 515 on volume of 2.5 million shekels.

MCAT	Jakarta stocks are expected to be mixed in early trading on Monday with the possibility that market sentiment may be affected by widening violence during campaign period ahead May 29 election, brokers said. However, they said investors were likely to snap up certain counters which have announced encouraging first quarter results such as retailer Matahari and salt producer Fiskaragung. On Sunday, supporters of Indonesia's ruling Golkar and a rival Moslem-oriented party clashed in several areas in east and south Jakarta in the second day of campaign violence in the capital ahead of May 29 elections.   Brokers and analysts predicted that concern over domestic political tension was likely to prompt further selling on blue chip counters but local-led speculative buying might continue on small stocks. Chemical producer Eterindo and shoe-maker Kasogi International was likely to reap market attention after Eterindo's encouraging debut on Friday and Kasogi's plan for rights issue, brokers said. Blue chip Semen Gresik was expected to come under selling pressure on the perception that its first quarter result might not meet market expectations, brokers said.   On Friday, the Jakarta Composite Index rose 0.09 points, or 0.01 percent, to close at 657.07 points after earlier falling to 654.68 points. Big-caps Sampoerna, Semen Gresik and Indosat were among the losers due to the weak sentiment, brokers said. Market talk of possible below-expected first quarter results have also further dampened sentiment, analysts said. "Talk that Semen Gresik may have posted poor first quarter results dampened sentiment on the stock," one analyst with a large brokerage firm said. "Gresik had already disappointed the market as it failed to meet the market's forecast for 1996 results. If they fail again this time, the punishment will be hard," she said.   Semen Gresik fell 275 rupiah to 5,300 rupiah with some 1.4 million shares traded after touching a year-low of 5,275 rupiah. The previous year-low was 5,525 rupiah on Friday. The analyst, however, said with an expected earnings per share growth of 30 percent this year and another strong EPS growth in 1998, the firm should offer good buying opportunities for long-term investors. Semen Gresik announced today it planned to buy a 25-percent stake in ready mixed concrete producer PT Varia Usaha Beton for 8.3 billion rupiah.   The analyst, however, said the purchase would not have any impact on the firm's bottom line as the results from Varia would not be included in Gresik's consolidated results. Officials of Semen Gresik were not immediately available for comment. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364

GCAT	China on Thursday congratulated the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) on its 30th birthday and said it hoped for closer ties with member states, some of which have strained relations with Beijing. Chinese President Jiang Zemin, in a letter to his Philippine counterpart Fidel Ramos, congratulated ASEAN on its founding 30 years ago, saying the group was a force for peace and development in the region, the Xinhua news agency said. "China stands ready to work with ASEAN countries to develop friendly and good-neighbourly relations... and bring about a lasting peace and development in the region," Xinhua quoted Jiang as saying in the letter. Beijing supported ASEAN's decision last month to admit Laos and Burma as new members in a move that would help regional stability, Jiang said. "China has all along supported and will continue to support ASEAN in its efforts to play a positive role in regional and international affairs," Jiang said. "The relationship between China and ASEAN is now entering a new phase of an all-round development," he said. ASEAN consists of Brunei, Burma, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, and has often included regional power China as a dialogue partner. Beijing's claim to all islands and reefs in the South China Sea has landed it in disputes with some ASEAN members, who view the organisation as an important security umbrella against a rising China. China and Vietnam have fought over land and sea borders and Beijing and Manila have been locked in an dispute over the potentially resource-rich Spratly Islands. Analysts have said the recent admission of Burma, a China ally, into ASEAN was partly aimed at curbing Beijing's influence in the region. Beijing also has positive ties with other ASEAN states, with Thailand being a big buyer of Chinese weapons as well as one of the biggest sources of investment in China.
MCAT	Swedish debt yields were trading higher in the early session Monday on more selling following Friday's U.S.-driven slide. The crown was still softer against the dollar whilst the mark slipped against the Swedish currency. Trade was rather quiet and no dramatic movements were expected because no significant economic data was due. "Some buyers might reappear if foreign markets gain ground, but right now there is no interest on the longer end of the market, possibly some on the short side," one trader said.   The ten-year bond yield climbed five basis points to 6.51 percent and five-year bond yields were up five basis points at 5.81 percent. The six month T-bill rate traded one basis point higher at 4.31 percent. The crown firmed to 4.3095 crowns versus 4.3260 crowns late on Friday. The dollar was still flexing its muscles: the crown dropped to 8.0472 crowns compared to 8.0270 crowns on Friday afternoon. The U.S. currency was expected to remain firm, dealers said. However, some players were concerned the Bundesbank would raise its repo rate because of the firm dollar. -- Stockholm newsroom, Kristina Zetterlund +46-8 700 1005
MCAT	U.S. Treasuries were steady to easier by Tokyo midday on Tuesday, with light position adjustment dominant ahead of the release of U.S. retail sales data at 1230 GMT, traders said. The market's tone continued to be firm, but Asian participants were unwilling to trade actively until they assessed the trend of the U.S. economy from the retail data. "People are waiting for the retail sales. The outcome should give some idea to the market whether the Fed will further tighten credit at the FOMC meeting (on May 20)," a Japanese commercial bank trader said.

GCAT	Up to 3 feet (1 metre) of snow accompanied by flooding and widespread power outages plagued the northern plains Monday, after a huge spring storm struck over the weekend. Roads and many major highways were closed across the region that included the Dakotas, and parts of Nebraska and Minnesota. North Dakota officials asked President Clinton to declare the state a disaster area. "Driving is extremely treacherous. The majority of main roads are still closed -- it's nasty," said Capt. Pat Richards of North Dakota's Division of Emergency Management. "You name it, we've got it. This is crazy," he said. Floodwaters from an inch (2.5 cm) of rain added to the previous week's snow-melt, triggering flooding in Wahpeton, North Dakota, and across the Red River in Breckenridge, Minnesota. At least 45 families had to be evacuated during the weekend blizzard, Richards said. Hundreds of high-voltage power towers collapsed during the storm, as heavy rain froze on electrical wires. High winds caused the lines to "gallop," bringing down the towers. Thousands of people across the region could be without power for several days, Richards said. Severe weather across the Midwest brought down tree limbs and knocked out power to thousands of people. Detroit shut down its schools for the day. Several rivers overflowed their banks, including the Sheyenne in North Dakota and the Minnesota River in Minnesota. Below-freezing temperatures accompanied by strong winds made fighting the flood more difficult. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers shut down a section of the Upper Mississippi River to traffic because of rising waters.

The 26-year-old striker signed a contract with Freiburg until June 1998 and is expected to play in a German Cup match on Wednesday against Stuttgart. Sternkopf has appeared in 161 Bundesliga matches and scored a total of 13 goals for Karlsruhe, Bayern Munich and Moenchengladbach.
MCAT	The Belgian share market, up more than two percent at a record high on Wednesday on the back of hopes U.S. interest rates would not rise soon, was groomed for further gains, traders and analysts said. "The index can add another five to seven percent before the end of the summer holidays," said analyst Herman Cels at Cels, Guigon Securities BV. At 0827 GMT the Bel-20 was up 2.00 percent at 2,590.21 points after earlier touching 2,598.48. Its previous high of 2,562.94 was set one week ago. The index was boosted by bullish comments from U.S. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan.   The Bel-20 index's performance reflected similar gains on neighbouring markets and followed the overnight surge of nearly 155 points on Wall Street prompted by Greenspan's comments, in the first part of his congressional testimony, containing no unsettling remarks on the economy or financial markets. Traders and analysts said they expected the Bel-20 to breach the 2,600-point barrier in the next few sessions. Nineteen Bel-20 stocks were higher and utility holding company Tractebel was steady. Chemicals and drugs company UCB, the star of trading earlier this month, was relatively subdued with a 2.1 percent rise to 146,000. -- Bert Lauwers, Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6815, Fax +32 2 230 7710

GCAT	Scientists believe thousands of pelicans that died at a California wildlife reserve may have been killed by avian botulism caused by eating infected fish. So far 6,266 pelicans have died at the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge in the Imperial Valley, some 150 miles (240 km) east of San Diego. In all 8,672 birds of 51 species died in the past month. Toni Rocke, an animal epidemiologist for the National Wildlife Health Research Centre in Madison, Wisconsin, found the deadly botulism in 40 percent of 70 fish sampled from the inland sea, a spokeswoman said. "Dr. Rocke is positive right now in saying the source of botulism in pelicans is the fish," said Susan Saul, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "What we don't know is whether the pelicans are eating sick fish, dead fish or live fish to get the botulism." Avian botulism has been known to kill waterfowl that eat maggots found in dead fish, but pelicans do not eat maggots or dead fish. They generally eat only live fish. How the fish acquired the toxin, "we don't know," Saul said.
MCAT	White sugar futures finally made an effort to push higher on Thursday afternoon after New York's May raws contract briefly broke through the 11.00 cents/lb mark, traders said. "London has just followed suit -- it's seen a bit of movement but it's still stuck in a range," said one. Trade buying in London, coupled with commission house crosses, provided the impetus for the rise on the whites but profit-takers then moved in to cap the gains.

CCAT	Midland Resources Inc said Wednesday it is disappointed in the results in the Fusselman formation on the southern flank of the Chalk Mountain Project in West Texas' Permian Basin, particularly the Cope 34A-2 development location. "We have made a significant reduction in the anticipated total Fusselman development locations from 13 to 7 and Fusselman reserve estimates based of our original discovery and seismic interpretation were reduced from 2.54 to 1.37 million barrels of oil equivalent."   The company said the data it has accumulated is being assessed and "we are remapping the seismic data utilizing this new information. We anticipate resumption of project development drilling in the fourth quarter." Midland said it completed the Cope 34-1 as a discovery in the Wolfcamp formation. In a 24 hour test, the well pumped at a stabilized daily rate of 30 barrels of oil. The company noted it had drilled the well as an unsuccessful exploration well to the Fusselman in an attempt to expand the area of its Chalk Mountain Project.   Seismic interpretation of the data is being prepared and assessed to determine additional Wolfcamp potential in the project. Similarly, the company said, it drilled the Cope 28-1 on the eastern side of the project to test another Fusselman feature and the unsuccessful attempt was completed in the Canyon formation. This well is not expected to produce at high rates, but pressure tests indicate an extensive reservoir and seismic and other data is being reviewed to determine additional Canyon development potential.   Midland said the Cope 34A-2 was drilled as the first development well to the Fusselman discovery well drilled in March 1997 and was structurally low to 3D seismic mapping of the Fusselman. This well is currently being completed as a producer in the Company operated Cope Spraberry Waterflood Unit. President Deas Warley stated, "We have not fully assessed the reserve potential in the Wolfcamp and Canyon formations. One piece of good news we had in drilling the Cope 28-1 was that the well appears to be a flank well to a small Fusselman structural feature on the eastern side of the project.   "The Fusselman in this well was in a different member of the Fusselman than that in the discovery well and tested with high flow rates and excellent reservoir pressures. We are reviewing both 3D and 2D seismic in the area of this feature and anticipate the possibility of an exploratory test well later this year or early 1998." After an unsuccessful exploratory well to test the potential of a Wolfcamp/Strawn/Canyon feature on the western flank of the Latigo Project, the company said, it has started drilling the Gerlach 1, a Strawn/Canyon development well offsetting the original Latigo discovery well, the Caddell 1. The Caddell 1 was completed as a Canyon discovery well in March 1997 producing at an initial rate of 144 barrels of oil per day and currently producing at 75 barrels of oil per day.

ECAT	The Polish economy slowed slightly in February due to seasonal factors, but was growing faster than a year ago, when winter weather was much harsher than this year, the Central Statistical Office (GUS) said. "This year winter was not as harsh as last year, which had a positive effect on the economy," deputy GUS president Janusz Witkowski told a news conference on Friday. Industrial production in February eased 2.8 percent against January but was still 8.7 percent higher than in February 1996. Production in the January-February period of this year was 9.5 percent higher than in the same period last year. He said the number of jobless in February eased by some 24,000 people. The unemployment rate for February will be announced by the labour ministry on Monday. "The progress in reducing unemployment was not very impressive last month, but it is important that we did not see the usual at this time of year increase in the number of jobless," Witkowski said. The rate for January was 13.5 percent with the number of jobless at 2.34 million people. He welcomed a further slow-down in the growth of consumer and producer prices in February noting the slower rise of food prices -- long the main engine of the consumer price index. Consumer prices rose 1.1 percent in February after a 2.9 percent rise in January bringing the year-on-year index down to 17.3 percent. Producer prices rose 0.6 percent last month against 1.8 percent in January taking the year-on-year figure down to 10.5 percent. "However, the slow-down in inflation in the January- February period is still smaller than one could expect if this year's targets envisaged by the budget are to be met," Witkowski said. Poland aims to bring down inflation to 13 percent in year-on-year terms in 1997 from 18.5 percent in 1996 and to 15.0 percent in average annual terms from 19.9 percent in 1996.
CCAT	Norfolk Southern Corp was preparing Monday to buy nearly 10 percent of Conrail Inc. in a move that would further cement a stalemate in the three-month-old fight for control of the railroad giant. The steps were taking place as Conrail and CSX Corp. assessed their strategy following Friday's shareholder defeat of a key measure in their proposed $9.4 billion merger. "We've entered a stage where no one has ever been before. We're sailing in uncharted waters," said one source close to Conrail and CSX who did not want to be identified.   Spurned bidder Norfolk Southern last week promised to acquire 9.9 percent of Conrail for $115 a share if the railroad's stockholders defeated the provision that would have allowed the Conrail-CSX transaction to proceed. Preliminary results showed that about 53 percent of Conrail's outstanding shares were voted against the measure. The 9.9 percent investment is the maximum amount of Conrail stock that Norfolk Southern can purchase without triggering Conrail's poison pill anti-takeover defense. "We will move without delay on our tender offer," said Norfolk Southern spokesman Robert Fort.   The formal process was not expected to begin until later in the week when Conrail released final vote results. Once it buys the stake, both Norfolk Southern and CSX will hold sizable investments in Conrail without any imminent opportunity to buy the rest of the company. CSX, which bought 19.9 percent of Conrail in November as part of the planned friendly deal, needs to win approval of Conrail shareholders to proceed with the cash and stock transaction. Many shareholders favor Norfolk Southern's $10.3 billion cash offer, which has been rejected by Conrail.   Under its pact with CSX, Conrail is prohibited from merging with another company until 1999. "Right now, it's a standoff," said one Wall Street trader. Conrail has vowed to convince shareholders that the proposed transaction with CSX is a better fit than the Norfolk Southern offer and plans to schedule another shareholder vote. No meeting date has been set yet. "The next step in the strategy hasn't been determined. I don't think that there's any rush. We're not going anywhere," said a source close to the situation.   But Conrail apparently plans to keep a low profile for the next few days. Sources said the railroad has cancelled a traditional meeting with analysts to discuss fourth quarter earnings, due to be released Wednesday. Meanwhile, speculation abounds about the eventual outcome of the three-way battle. Wall Street analysts and traders have theorized that CSX may be forced to sweeten its offer for Conrail, despite repeated statements from CSX that no higher bid is forthcoming. And other experts speculate Conrail's board may pursue a three-way deal among the railroads at some point, especially if Conrail's stock price erodes from current levels of about $103 per share.
GCAT	King Birendra accepted Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's resignation on Thursday after his 17-month-old centre-right coalition was defeated in a confidence vote in parliament, Nepal's state radio said. "His majesty the King in accordance with the constitution of Nepal, 1990, has accepted the resignation tendered by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba on the ground that a resolution tabled by him for the vote of confidence was defeated in the parliament," it quoted a palace communique as saying.   King Birendra asked Deuba's government led by his centrist Nepali Congress party to continue until the formation of a new council of ministers, the announcement said. Deuba's government received 101 votes against a required minimum of 103 during voting in the 205-seat lower house on the motion, which he had moved to try to demonstrate the coalition's majority. A total of 92 deputies voted against the motion. The Nepali Congress party, which has 87 seats, lost its majority last December following a split in the ranks of one of its two partners, the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), which had 19 seats. The opposition communist United Marxist-Leninist (UML) party and its allies control 94 votes.
GCAT	Zaire has welcomed a proposal by a European Union special envoy for a regional meeting before any international conference on the conflict-ridden Great Lakes region. Aldo Ajello arrived in Zaire on Saturday and met President Mobutu Sese Seko in the northern town of Gbadolite on Sunday and the foreign minister on Monday in Kinshasa. A statement from the Foreign Ministry said the intended meeting would gather not only the heads of states who took part in last year's Nairobi summit but also those from other African countries and donors as well. "The Zairian government does not object to the principle of holding a follow-up meeting on the Nairobi summit that would gather more African countries and international donors before the international conference," the statement said. But the statement said that prior to participating in the conference, Zaire wants 'invading forces" off its soil. "To avoid any ambiguity, the goals of such a conference have to be well specified and agreed to by everybody," it added. Speaking on national television after meeting Zaire's foreign minister, Ajello said that his job was to find a peaceful way out of the crises in the region. "The thing is to reach a solution without resorting to force," Ajello said. Rwandan-backed rebels have captured a portion of Zaire's territory along the border with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. The authorities in Kinshasa have repeatedly accused the three neighbouring states of direct involvement in the war. Zaire's army launched a much-trumpeted but ineffective counter-offensive last month. While the front-line seems to be edging west, closer to the Rwandan refugee camp of Tingi-Tingi, the defence minister has urged the local press to boost the morale of the ill-paid army. "It is no longer conceivable to hear or read inaccurate information that can demoralise the army and the population... and praise the enemy while concealing the atrocities he is committing," General Liku Lia Bolongo told journalists on Monday. He said that the Defence Ministry would from now on regularly brief the press on the latest developments on the battlefield. The statement from the Foreign Ministry said the elections would take place across the vast Central African country, including the rebel-held provinces of North and South Kivu. In theory the elections will be held by July this year, but many doubt that the deadline for the long-awaited polls will be met. Jello will wind up his current visit to Zaire on Tuesday.

They saw foreign funds behind the bulk of activity on market favourites such as as Jordan Cement, Jordan Phospate Mines, and Arab Potash Co. Only a fraction of the demand was coming from local insititutions, dealers said. The official 60-share Amman Financial Market (AFM) index shed 0.17 percent to 155.86 points in healthy trade worth 1,523,559 dinars ($2.1 million).

It however fell 0.01 dinars to 3.92 dinars in high turnover worth 752,613 dinars. The second heavily traded stock, Jordan Phosphates, was unchanged at 3.50 dinars in large trade worth 187,921 dinars. Arab Potash rose 0.06 dinars in trade worth 51,390 dinars while National Portfolio shed 0.04 dinars to 1.13 dinars in trade worth 67,071 dinars. But Arab Bank, which is heavily weighted on the official index, continued a downward pattern for a third day in a row, shedding 1.00 dinars to 256 dinars. Overall falling shares outnumbered gainers by 26 to 10 while 19 were unchanged. The private Pearl Index of the 45 best-performing shares in terms of turnover and financial performance shed 0.41 percent to 79.78 points, 4.34 percent down from the start of the year. -- Amman newsroom +9626 623776
ECAT	India's trade deficit could worsen if export growth slumped further and the government should move to reverse the trend, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) said. The FICCI said India's exports growth fell to 9.8 percent in the first five months of fiscal 1996/97 (April-March) compared with 28 percent in the same period last year. "Unless remedial steps are taken expeditiously, the balance of payments position is likely to pose a new threat, not experienced during the last four years of economic reform," FICCI said in a study. India's trade deficit was $7.2 billion in 1995/96, it said. "The trade deficit...would escalate and the year would end with a larger deficit than that of 1995/96," FICCI said. The chairman of FICCI's foreign trade committee, Y.K. Modi, called for measures to attract businessmen to boost exports at a meeting to discuss ways to accelerate export growth. "Rules have to be such as to be business oriented and induce people to get into the export business," Modi said. Commerce Minister Bolla Buli Ramaiah urged India's finance ministry to take steps to arrest the deceleration in order to lift export growth to 20 percent annually, equivalent to $38 billion, by March next year. The remarks were made in a speech read to the FICCI meeting because Ramaiah was unable to attend. Indian exports grew by 20.6 percent in the year 1995/96, the FICCI study said. But growth in 1996/97 will fall short of the 20 percent target the government set, it concluded. FICCI noted that the deceleration in exports had gone hand in hand with an economic slowdown that saw a drop in gross domestic product and a fall in industrial output. Ramaiah said he had recommended that the Finance Ministry exempt manufacturing exporters from the proposed Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) which he feared would hinder export growth. Finance Minister P. Chidambaram announced the compulsory levy in the annual budget in July, to plug loopholes in the corporate tax sector. -- New Delhi newsroom +91-11-301 2024

CCAT	Financial consultants Alpha Trust issued a buy recommendation on shares of OTE telecom, Nirefs fisheries and construction firm Hellenic Technodomiki, in their September report. OTE telecoms, the Athens bourse's largest quoted company representing 28 percent of market capitalisation has the largest weight in the Athens benchmark share index. It went public at 4,000 drachmas a share. "The Greek telecommunications market is expected to grow to 1.5 trillion drachmas by the year 2000 from 890 billion this year. For 1996 we expect 27 percent growth in earnings before tax, while the P/E ratio is 6.6," it said. OTE will achieve a substantial increase in the percentage of digital lines -- 40 percent this year from 6.0 percent in 1991 and this will boost its revenues, the report said. Alpha Trust is also bullish on shares of Nirefs, one of the largest fish farming firms in Europe whose main products include sea bream and sea bass. "The company has adequate production capacity and now aims to produce and package new products such as smoked fish. It will enter the frozen fish market and diversify exports. Its distribution network covers Greece and extends to all major European markets." Shares of Nirefs which have retreated 11.7 percent in the last 12 months are trading at a 1996 P/E ratio of 9.3. Last year the bulk of its sales, 63 percent in volume terms, was directed abroad, mostly to Italy. Alpha Trust also liked shares of construction firm Hellenic Technodomiki despite a flat first half as 60 percent of its turnover comes from the private sector. The stock has shed 27.4 percent in the last 12 months, trading at a P/E of 8.2. In the food and beverage sector, it said shares of Goody's, the leading fast food chain, were a hold as they traded at 18 times 1996 expected earnings. "Although very well placed in the market, Goody's, with a chain of 99 franchised restaurants faces higher distribution and promotion expenses this year due to increasing competition," it said. The stock has gained 26.2 percent in the last 52 weeks. Alpha Trust called it right in its August review placing shares of Titan Cements on its buy list, expecting strong earnings this year. The company posted first half earnings growth of 63.9 percent last week. --George Georgiopoulos, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4

CCAT	PaineWebber Inc said Monday that it had named Roberts Brokaw III and Reginald Hollinger as managing directors in its Investment Banking division. Brokaw, who will head PaineWebber's corporate finance group, had been with Roberts Brokaw LLC, an independent investment banking concern, PaineWebber said. He is an adjunct finance professor at New York University Leonard N. Stern School of Business and previously spent 22 years at Merrill Lynch & Co's investment banking division. Hollinger, a former principal with Morgan Stanley's corporate finance department focusing on telecommunications, will head PaineWebber's telecommunications industry group within the technology, telecommunications and media investment banking sector.

GCAT	Pakistani newspapers and analysts hailed an Indian-Pakistani agreement on an agenda for peace talks between South Asia's threshold nuclear rivals, but said there was no room for euphoria. "While the outcome of the foreign secretaries' meeting is a good omen, expectations of the future course of talks need to be viewed in the context of ground realities of bilateral relations," former foreign minister Agha Shahi told Reuters. Foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan on Monday set an agenda for peace talks to discuss all outstanding issues between them, placing peace and security and their dispute on the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir at the top. "This productive outcome on the procedure and methodology of the future negotiations between the two foreign secretaries reflects credit on their performance," Shahi said. But he added: "These are purely procedural talks. They have not gone into the substance of anything. They have only agreed to say that we will discuss Jammu and Kashmir and all that." Shahi said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Inder Kumar Gujral, both keen to reduce tension and promote amity, must take the credit for setting the atmosphere for the talks He said a "minefield" awaited the negotiators on issues such as Pakistani complaints over India's human rights record and military deployment in Kashmir and India's missile programmes. An editorial in the English-language daily The News described the outcome as encouraging but said it was too early to celebrate the start of normalisation between the old enemies, who have fought three wars since independence 50 years ago. "The admittedly positive outcome of the second round of talks ought also to be seen against the sobering lessons from the past attempts to break the logjam, which, after giving initials signs of hope, failed to produce peace," it said. "Whether it is Kashmir, Siachen or other outstanding disputes in the India-Pakistan equation, India's behaviour will demonstrate how sincere it is in taking the peace process forward," The News said. "Until then, there is room only for guarded optimism." The Frontier Post daily said the India-Pakistan statement was positive, but warned of anti-peace lobbies in each nation. "The two countries still have powerful groups that would love to see this process undermined sooner rather than later. "If there are many Indians who would like to scuttle the peace process, Pakistan too has powerful lobbies who seek deliberate confrontation with India as a manifestation of robust patriotism," The Frontier Post added. But the paper said a significant number of people in both countries realised the perils of militarisation. "It is important that leaders on both sidess of the subcontinental divide keep their cool to allow the next foreign secretary-level meeting to make still greater progress," it said.
CCAT	Mexican conglomerate Grupo Carso bought a three percent stake in Apple Computer Inc, a source close to the group told Reuters on Thursday. "Grupo Carso acquired (the stake) for $60 million at a share price of $16," the source said, but declined to give a date for the transaction. The source declined to be identified. The source added that early gains by Carso Global Telecom (CGT), a holding company with links to Grupo Carso, "had absolutely nothing to do" with the Apple deal. Dealers said shares listed by Grupo Carso and CGT had gained sharply in early trade on press reports of the acquisition of the stake in Apple. CGT shares had trimmed earlier gains but were still ahead 1.00 pesos at 34.00 at midday trade. Grupo Carso was meanwhile up 1.20 pesos at 63.50.

MCAT	CBOT soybean futures closed weaker on Tuesday after the November contract expired lower, lending a softer tone to the market, traders said. A late selloff in soyoil futures tied to heavy fund selling also pressured the market. "Funds sold oil late plus the tone was set earlier in the day when November beans went off weak," said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds. The November expired at 1201 CST Tuesday at $7.05-1/2 per bushel, down 5-3/4 cents. Continental Grain was said to be a small-lot seller in the final minute of trading. On the day, Iowa Grain sold four million bushels January and Griffin Trading bull spread five million bushels January/March, traders said. Cargill Inc and Term Commodities were said to be buyers of the January while Refco Inc was a noted seller, traders said.

GCAT	A Texas woman who set out more than two months ago to complete the doomed flight of Amelia Earhart is preparing to take off on the last and most challenging leg of her journey around the world. Linda Finch told reporters on Thursday she expects to arrive back at her starting point of Oakland, California on May 28 following a few days of rest in Hawaii and an overnight flight across the Pacific Ocean. Finch's 1935 Lockheed Electra 10E plane, almost identical to Earhart's, will be strained by the heavy fuel load required for the 2,000-mile (3,200 kms) flight to Oakland. With just a two-hour margin on fuel, Finch said she may have to delay the trip or turn back if winds are too strong. She plans to take off for the final leg of the trip on May 27. "We'll be several tons over what the aircraft was designed for," Finch said. "It will be a very critical takeoff and we'll have to do everything perfectly." Finch took off on her "World Flight 1997" on March 17 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of legendary aviator Amelia Earhart. ln 1932, Earhart became the first woman to fly solo actross the Atlantic, but in 1937 she disappeared in the South Pacific while on an attempted flight around the world. No trace of her plane was ever found and the disappearance remains a mystery. Despite flying in the primitive plane, the 46-year-old Finch, a businesswoman and a grandmother, said her trip has been without major incident so far. "It is loud, small and somewhat uncomfortable, but there has really been no problem with it. The engines have run perfectly," she said. But she conceded her challenge was mild compared with the endeavours of the pioneering pilots of Earhart's day. One big difference is the modern navigation equipment installed in Finch's plane. "Would I have tried this Earhart's time? No. It was just too hard a flight. What pilots did in that time was so much more dangerous, risky and adventurous. They were absolutely leading the way," Finch said. Finch's journey has taken her across the United States to Brazil, Africa, Europe, Egypt, India, Thailand and Singapore. On May 18, she flew out of New Guinea, the point where Earhart disappeared 60 years ago. "I thought about how she must have been so elated at that point," said Finch. "She was really so close to home. And then to have not made it. It really struck me."
MCAT	Carryover short covering lifted CME lumber futures into technical buy stops in thin trade and May ran up the daily limit of $10.00 per thousand board feet before meeting resistance, traders said. At 0924 CST, lumber stood $9.30 to $1.00 per tbf higher with May up most at $373.00 and July up $6.10 at $367.00. Carryover demand pushed prices through technical resistance with buy stops touched off in May above $370. The market appeared oversold and increased ideas that improving weather will spark greater demand for lumber supported values, they said. ((Jerry Bieszk 312-408-8725))
GCAT	Japanese police are investigating a case where an Iranian man died after hitting his head during a scuffle with immigration officers, Japanese media reported on Tuesday. The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that Musavi Abarbekuh Mir Hoseyn died on Saturday after cracking his skull on the floor during a scuffle with immigration officers at a detention house in Tokyo where he was being detained. The Iranian was arrested in Tokyo on May 9 on suspicion of theft and the court gave him an 18-month suspended sentence and ordered him to be deported, the Yomiuri said. Police and immigration officials have declined to comment. Tokyo police and prosecutors said Hoseyn, wrapped in a blanket after a scuffle broke out between him and immigration officials at the detention house, toppled over and cracked his head on the floor, the Yomiuri reported. He fell unconscious and was carried to the hospital but later died, the reports said.
CCAT	Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd said that two seismic events on Wednesday had halted production at its Western Holdings Number 2 shaft but that output should resume by this evening or Friday morning. "The mine is in the process of repairing the shaft steelwork and is still assessing underground production areas to determine whether the underground workings suffered any damage," mine managers Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd said in a statement on Thursday. "Management are confident that production will resume either tonight (Thursday) or early tomorrow morning (Friday)." Anglo said nobody had been injured by the seismic events, which measured 3.3 and 2.9 on the Richter scale and which occurred at 1250 GMT and 1400 GMT respectively on Wednesday. Workers at the shaft had not been sent underground for safety reasons, Anglo said. Number 2 shaft is one of 23 shafts at the mine and represents some four percent of total Freegold production in a month, Anglo said. "The effect of a single day's lost production to overall Freegold production is therefore negligible," it said. Freegold produced 20,381 kg of gold in the three months to end-September. -- Johannesburg newsroom, +27 11 482 1003
CCAT	Airbus Industrie said on Friday that its partners had reached an understanding on plans to restructure the consortium. "The partners of Airbus Industrie met today in Paris and, as a result of the progress made, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) has been agreed. The MOU will be signed over the next few days, and a press statement will be issued simultaneously," an Airbus statement said in full. An Airbus spokeswoman refused all further comment.   The announcement on Friday left up in the air details of the form of the new entity and did not address differences between the partners over the restructuring which had slowed the agreement. Airbus is currently a "Groupement d'Interet Economique", a French legal entity which makes no profits or losses in its own right. Instead these go to four partners who make decisions by consensus. The partners agreed last July to turn the grouping into a corporation to streamline decision-making and production but disagreed on the shape of the new company. France wanted a minimal restructuring while German and British partners favoured a deeper change. Airbus is a consortium made up of French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) of Spain. Aerospatiale and Deutsche Airbus have 38 percent each. British Aerospace Plc has 20 percent and CASA four percent.
GCAT	Taleban commander Abdur Razzaq said on Tuesday he had called on former government military chief Ahmad Shah Masood to "surrender or be wiped out". Razzaq told Reuters at this town at the mouth of the Panjsher Valley, Masood's stronghold, that he had sent a letter to Masood saying that if he stopped fighting he would be forgiven.   "If he goes on fighting, we will clear the area of his presence," said Razzaq, who commands Taleban forces which have swept north from Kabul in the last few days. He said no time limit had been set for Masood to reply to the ultimatum, but he was busy planning an assault on the Panjsher valley. He was speaking after a strategy meeting with his officers at a small district office in this dusty town. There were constant interruptions from black-turbanned Taleban fighters.
CCAT	Electricity generator Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc turned in lower than expected half year profits on Thursday but hiked its dividend by 11 percent. "We aim to keep on delivering dividend improvement...doing it by expanding the business," chief executive Roger Young told Reuters in an interview. Pretax profits edged down to 61.3 million pounds ($101.6 million) from 61.7 million previously, below expectations of 63 to 70.7 million. The dividend was 5.28 pence per share. The shares were down 1-1/2 pence at 316.5p at 1145 GMT. Scottish Hydro said low rainfall had hit profits, as hydro-electric generation had been replaced in part by coal at a cost of 6.3 million pounds. But chairman Lord Wilson said in a statement that the second half had started well and he was confident of "an encouraging result for the full 12 month period." Scottish Hydro said it was preferred bidder for the 50 percent stake in Keadby power station, northeast England, owned by United Utilities, its joint venture partner there, and aimed to complete the deal by the end of the current financial year. Young said the plan would "increase costs but also increase profits", adding an extra 340 megaWatt of generation capacity to the company's existing portfolio. Scottish Hydro said the deal should increase gearing to around 50 percent if it went ahead and added that together with existing expenditure commitments, gearing should peak at 65 percent in 1998-99. "We are confident of the prospects for Keadby and look forward to the opportunity to exploit its capabilities in the market place," the company said in a statement. Young said the company aimed to boost market share to seven percent from a current four percent by 1999 with a total investment in combined heat and power (CHP) plant for commercial customers of over 150 million pounds. The company said that action taken to raise output and cut costs would improve performance over the next two to three years and added that raising standards was a key aim. Scottish Hydro said that changes proposed to capital allowances in the British budget in November were expected to reverse a trend of falling tax rates but added it would not be possible to predict the impact accurately until full details were known. The company will be looking to expand its domestic business, Young said, but a resumption of talks with British Gas on the sale of the latter's supply interests was unlikely, he added. "I would not be optimistic of a resumption," he said. British Gas announced in September that talks on the sale of its domestic gas supply business in England and Scotland to Scottish Hydro had been called off, scotching newspaper reports that the sale would bring in around 250 million pounds. Young said the breakdown was for administrative rather than commerical reasons. "There was no serious commercial difficulty that caused the project to be dropped...British Gas had a lot of competition for its (administrative) resources," he said. But he said the moment for the deal might now have passed. "Deals tend to have their day," he said, adding that there . were other discussions around, "but nothing that we can talk about."

ECAT	Consumer prices edged up modestly in August, the government said Friday, offering more proof that inflationary pressures at the retail level remain largely in check. The department said the Consumer Price Index rose 0.1 percent last month, following an increase of 0.3 percent in July. Food prices rose, while energy and apparel prices fell.   Excluding the typically volatile food and energy components, the "core" rate of inflation also rose 0.1 percent. That compared with an increase of 0.3 percent in July. Wall Street forecasters had expected a rise of 0.2 percent in both the overall and the core CPI rate. The report follows the department's release Thursday of producer price data showing that overall inflation at the wholesale level rose 0.3 percent, while the core rate fell 0.1 percent. Wall Street has focused closely on the inflation figures as it tries to predict whether the Federal Reserve might find it necessary to raise interest rates when its top policymakers meet on Sept. 24. Recent data have showed tighter conditions in the job market, suggesting that employers will need to pay higher wages to attract certain types of workers. Economists have feared that those higher labour costs could eventually be reflected in steeper prices at the cash register if businesses decide to pass them along to consumers. Food prices jumped 0.4 percent following an increase of 0.5 percent in the previous month, while housing was up 0.2 percent following a rise of 0.4 percent in July. Energy prices fell 0.6 percent after sliding 0.4 percent in July. New car prices were up 0.3 percent, while airline fares fell 0.3 percent. Apparel and upkeep prices dropped 1.4 percent, the biggest monthly decline since January 1949, when prices fell 1.9 percent. Apparel prices were down only 0.1 percent in July. Medical care posted an increase of 0.2 percent compared with a 0.3 percent increase in July.

"The government is studying ways to compensate the fiscal burden, in order to reduce it during 1997 to nine percent, which is the difference between the general VAT level and the reduced level," Costa told reporters.

ECAT	South Africa is considering putting in place a $1.5 billion syndicated loan facility for three years to draw down at times when there is pressure on the foreign exchnage reserves, Business Day newspaper said on Friday, quoting foreign banking sources.   Reserve Bank deputy governor James Cross said the central bank would always investigate various methods of financing in the market and a syndicted loan was one possibility. "No decisions have been taken and any reports on a syndicated loan facility are highly speculative at this stage. The Bank is not seeking new finance of any magnitude at this time," he told the paper. The trade journal International Financial Review referred to the Bank's discussions with foreign bankers in its latest issue, saying there were rumours that South Africa was on the verge of coming to market with a jumbo syndicated deal. -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003
GCAT	Lithuania said on Monday that it is glad the Nato-Russia charter would be signed before the Madrid meeting and that Moscow, which opposes the Baltic states' bids to join Nato, would have no veto over the alliance's decisions. "It is good that the charter will be signed before the Madrid meeting," Algirdas Saudargas, Lithuania's foreign minister, told a news conference during a one-day official visit to Latvia, the first by a Lithuanian foreign minister to the country's Baltic neighbour. "I am sure that we will see evidence in Madrid, that Russia has no right to a veto," he added. Lithuania earlier said that at least one Baltic state should join NATO in the first wave of enlargement. "This is just a method (of approaching the issue)..not aimed at breaking the co-operation of the Baltic states," Saudargas said. "Our strategic aims of joining EU and NATO are the same and also our tactics.. are very close or identical," Saudargas said. "By voicing such a position Lithuania has managed to draw more attention to the security issue of all the Baltic countries, keeping it in a high profile," Latvian foreign minister Valdis Birkavs said. "We can conclude that the approach of all of the three Baltic countries to the issue has been correct as we are getting lots of fresh ideas from the West," Birkavs said. -- Martinsh Gravitis, Riga Newsroom, +371 721 5240
MCAT	U.S. mortgage-backed securities traded lower in a quiet afternoon session, but scant retail buying caused yield spreads to tighten moderately over comparable Treasuries, traders said on Thursday. "Mortgages have put in a good day today, but I would'nt call it stellar," said one mortgage analyst. Traders speculated that a BankAmerica Corp trade pushed mortgage yield spreads closer to Treasuries'.   "BankAmerica Corp sold a number of adjustable-rate mortgages yesterday, and (today's movement) could be a redeployment of that money," said an analyst. "But certainly (the volume of) yesterday's trade couldn't be more than a splash in a pond," he added. Nevertheless, pass-throughs continued their slide from earlier losses and volume remained thin, traders said. Ginnie Mae 30-year 8.0 percent coupons were lower at 100-05/32, yielding 117 basis points over 10-year Treasuries.   Comparable Fannie Mae certificates dipped to 100-05/32, and Freddie Macs dropped to 100-09/32. Treasuries were lower in late trade, with the five-year note slipping to 99-14/32 to yield 6.63 percent. The 10-year bond fell to 101 to yield 6.86 percent. --Jeff Coelho, 212-859-1562
MCAT	The won closed weaker versus the dollar on Tuesday as most banks built up their dollar positions on belief the U.S. unit will rise further, traders said. They said the won's fall was in line with the dollar's strength against the Japanese yen overseas. The won crossed the finishing line at 831.60 after opening at a day's high of 830.50. It touched a low of 831.70 in early trading. "The dollar breaking the 114 yen level had a significant impact on the local market," said one trader.   Despite fears that Cho Hung Bank could sell off its dollar holdings created from global depository receipts (GDR) issues any minute, banks accumulated dollars. "The support is seen at the 830 level for the rest of December," said another trader at a local bank. Traders expected the won to stay between 830.00 and 832.50 on Wednesday. The central bank set the base mid-rate at 831.20 for Wednesday versus 829.50 on Tuesday. -- JEAN YOON (822) 727 5643
GCAT	A Springbok player has tested positive for the use of a banned substance, it was announced on Monday by the South African Rugby Football Union (SARFU). A news release from SARFU refused to name the player, but a report on a South African radio station named Northern Transvaal lock forward Johan Ackermann as the player in question. The player has asked for a second test of his sample, and SARFU will only take further action once the result is known, probably in 14 days. If the second test is positive, the player could face a ban of up to two years. SARFU chief executive Rian Oberholzer said: "The rules on this are very clear and any player who transgresses must face the consequences." SARFU's medical consultant Doctor Ismail Jakoet said: "We have begun our testing programme earlier than normal this year so we can enhance the effectiveness of our testing programme in the off season." Ironically, Ackermann was part of a 27-man Springbok squad sent for a full pre-season medical evaluation at the Cape Town Sports Institute two weeks ago.

MCAT	Great demand for heavyweight stocks characterised trade on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on Tuesday with the top 10 trades all heavyweights and making up nearly half of the day's overall 1.3 billion rand turnover, dealers said. "Of the 10 most active trades all were heavyweights and they totalled about 500 million rand. Overall volume was 1.3 billion rand. That's where all the major actvity was," said Johann Marais of Societe Generale Frankel Pollak. Big traders on the day included Gencor, Sasol, Anglo, SA Breweries and De Beers. Gencor drew much interest from the start of trade on the back of a successful London listing for its metal arm Billiton earlier. Gencor saw 71 million rands worth of shares change hands and finished 20 cents up at 19.20 rand. Dealers said other heavyweight stocks probably drew investors because of the weaker rand which made rand hedge shares attractive. But generally heavyweights did not close the day much up on their previous levels and dealers said this was due to good two-way trade. "There was a lot of good two-way trade because they weren't pushed up. Generally the indices finished flat," a dealer said. Richemont ended steady at 70.50 rand in turnover of 56 million rand and Remgro added 30 cents to 45.50 rand with 52 million rands worth of shares changing hands. Sasol closed flat at 59 rand with shares worth 66 million rand trading, Anglo added 100 cents to 260 rand with 63 million rands of shares traded, SA Breweries cut 75 cents to 140.25 rand with 58 million rand traded and De Beers shed 50 cents to 164.50 rand with 46 million rand changing hands.   The all-share and industrial index finished flat. Industrials closed 5.2 points up at 8,984.9 points and the all-share index dipped 1.7 points to 7,430. Golds were a bit fragile on the bullion price which spent much of the day struggling to escape a tight $325-$326 an ounce range. The gold index closed 15 points off at 993.2. Dealers said local interest was distinctly lacking and not much futures-related trade occurred. They said earlier that there were not the right margins for basket-trading and arbitrage. Overall the market was hesitant ahead of U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's congress address later. But dealers said the general feeling was that Greenspan would indicate that U.S. interest rates would remain unchanged for now. Should Wall Street be cheered by that and finish firmer overnight, local stocks could take the cue and move up on Wednesday, although most eyes were on local economic indicators like June trade data which is scheduled for release later in the week. "At the moment we're not really following Wall Street and the focus is on local conditions . Greenspan could hint that there won't be a need to move rates and if Wall Street goes firmer that could offer some direction," Marais said. Dealers said that on Wednesday local shares were likely to start neutral to slightly firmer.   South Africa's near-term equity futures market was quiet on the day, dealers said. Industrial contracts were firmer in late trade, supported by a stronger local bond market but golds were flat, hampered by bullion's struggle to break its tight range. Dealers said the market was cautious ahead of Greenspan's speech later which could affect U.S. markets. Near-term industrial contracts were last at 8,580/86 from 8,543, all-shares were 6,721/28 from 6,718 and golds were 708/712 from 711. -- Melanie Cheary, Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482-1003
MCAT	Premiums on nickel offered to the U.S. Mint on Tuesday showed a marked softening from recent levels and from the previous tender, traders said. The Mint was out to buy 250 tonnes of Western grade nickel and traders said the winning bids will almost certainly include those presented by traders Hochschild Partners and Phoenixx International at 9.00 to 9.25 cents per pound over LME cash. This is considerably lower than in the previous tender which was won at premiums of 11 to 14.5 cents per pound, traders said. "This is puzzling because market premiums are higher now than they were during the last tender," a merchant said. Another dealer added,"It's put a dampener on things in terms of the last tender. Market premium levels are still good although they have waned. The market has been struggling a bit up here." Some traders said the Mint is able to obtain the most competitive premiums and the latest tender will probably be the bottom end of the new market range, with higher premiums still achievable on smaller, truckload quantities.

ECAT	Russia has improved its dismal record of tax collection this month, but Finance Minister Alexander Livshits admitted on Tuesday that Moscow was not yet meeting tough IMF demands. Speaking a day after the arrival of an advance party of experts from the International Monetary Fund, Livshits told reporters on Tuesday that negotiations were tricky. "Talks are definitely difficult. Definitely difficult," he said. "They are showing us shortcomings in the fulfilment of our promises for the entire programme and are asking us whether these are incorrect. They are correct." Livshits said Russian tax collection, which the IMF has said is a cause of concern, had improved steadily since October. Russia collected just 74 percent of target revenues in the first nine months of this year. But Yegor Stroyev, chairman of the Federation Council upper chamber of parliament told Livshits and a meeting of economists that only 16 percent of Russian firms paid tax and they owed 132 trillion roubles ($24 billion) as of October 1. The head of the lower house of parliament's budget committee said parliament would not pass the entire 1997 budget this year. Parliament, which is dominated by communists and their allies, rejected the government's first draft of the budget last month and budget committee chairman Mikhail Zadornov said the government was unwilling to submit a new draft. The economy is struggling with a paralysing shortage of cash -- the government is unable to pay its bills while firms are unable to pay taxes and bills to each other, leading to a huge secondary economy based on barter trade. The IMF has delayed handing over one tranche of its three-year $10 billion loan to Russia because it was worried about low rax revenues. An IMF mission will examine Russian figures again this week, but some experts have already arrived. $1=5,450 roubles

GCAT	Eight grenades were launched against a Spanish Civil Guard barracks late on Wednesday in the Basque region, hours after a similar attack on a police barracks in the region, police said. No one was injured and there was little damage in either attack. Two of the grenades in the most recent attack fell inside the installations and rest landed outside. Regional officials said Basque separatist rebels ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) were responsible for the attack, which was the fourth against the barracks in Inchaurrondo. ETA has often targetted security forces in its struggle for Basque independence. It has killed some 800 people since 1968.
MCAT	Bund futures resumed their downward course of last week, drifting much of the Monday in negative territory in what traders described as dull trade. Traders said the market was on edge about details of the government's traditional New Year's Bund issue which will be made public on Tuesday and were unwilling to take aggressive positions ahead of a slew of German and U.S. economic data due later in the week. At 1455 GMT, the DTB Bund future was down 17 basis points at 99.55, but off an early low of 99.43.

ECAT	Investments in Iran's industrial sector grew at an average 19 percent over the past eight years to 10 trillion rials or $7 billion, a senior Iranian official said. The official IRNA news agency quoted Iran's Minister of Industries Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh on Sunday as saying the average growth of investment in the country's economy during the period stood at an annual 11 percent. Nematzadeh, who was speaking to reporters in Tehran, said growth in the industrial sector peaked to nine percent from two percent at the beginning of the first five-year plan (1989-94), but more investments were needed to boost this trend. It was not clear from the report whether the minister's comments included oil and non-oil related industries. He said all production units damaged during the 1980-88 war with Iraq had been either reconstructed or totally renovated by his ministry. ($1=1,750 rials at the official exchange rate)

MCAT	European high sulphur fuel prices were steady on Tuesday, unbowed by the threat of Russian supplies, but low sulphur values were slipping in the face of a shut U.S. arb and plentiful August barrels, traders said. High sulphur barges traded at $89.50 and $90 for prompt delivery, and later moved at $91.50 and $92 a tonne for August. "There was bitty volume but sentiment was stable to firm, with a little bit more demand and avails tight," said one trader, summing up the day in the ARA barge market. Russian cracked cargoes were coming into the region, but Med demand for bunker spec fuel oil was thought likely to soak up supply and limit the dampening effect on ARA barge numbers. One Russian cargo was traded on Tuesday, and was variously heard priced at a small premium to the means or at $88.50 a tonne. Low sulphur was under pressure, with swaps losing $1 and one U.K. refiner heard asking just $92-$93 for a cargo, though players thought this a lowballing quote.   Though with the arb shut to the States and a cluster of cargoes due in mid-August there was little to stop the grade hitting a price of $92 a tonne in days ahead, traders said. -- Sean Maguire, London newsroom +44 171 542 8060 (c) Reuters Limited 1997
GCAT	The morbid tale of one woman's love for human remains has turned a small Canadian film into a runaway success story. "Kissed," the story of a young necrophile who takes a funeral home job to pursue her passion, is garnering critical praise rare for a film of its kind. Shot on a shoestring budget, the independently made feature became a film festival favorite before it landed a coveted U.S. distribution deal. Critics have raved, including the powerful TV team of Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, who gave it "two thumbs up" ahead of its U.S. release last week. Hollywood has also taken notice, with director Lynne Stopkewich and star Molly Parker fielding offers from major studios. "The shocking thing is how widely it has been embraced," the 33-year old Vancouver-based director said. "I never imagined that we'd have such mainstream acceptance." "Kissed," based on Barbara Gowdy's short story "We So Seldom Look on Love," tells the story of a woman obsessed with death. It traces her adult sexual longing for corpses to her childhood fixation on dead animals. It was the strength and unapologetic nature of the main character, Sandra Larson, that compelled Stopkewich to make a film from the story, she said, citing surrealist director David Lynch as a major influence. "I'm really interested in provocative cinema and films that take you somewhere you haven't been before," she said. "I feel like my job as filmmaker is to take the rock, turn it over and see what's underneath." NUDITY AS WELL AS DEATH "Kissed" is provocative, including full frontal nudity, a lesson on embalming and vivid depictions of Parker entwined with corpses. Parker concedes she had qualms about taking the role but in the end the part was too rich to pass up. "I thought it would be an incredible challenge to bring this character to life in a way that made people want to understand why she did the things she does," the 24-year old Parker said. Given its subject matter and nationality, "Kissed" has drawn comparisons to Canadian director David Cronenberg's "Crash," a film about a group of people erotically obsessed with car crashes. But unlike "Crash," which sparked calls for censorship in Britain and Argentina, "Kissed" has attracted surprisingly little controversy. "There's nothing that disturbing or offensive about 'Kissed.' What's miraculous about the film and what makes it a success is how tender, delicate and tasteful it is, considering that its heroine is a necrophile," Brian Johnson, film critic for Canadian newsweekly Maclean's, wrote. Johnson said "Kissed" was typical of recent Canadian films such as "Crash" and Atom Egoyan's "Exotica" in that it explored inviduals alienated from normal society. He said that was not surprising as moviemaking in Canada was something of a fringe industry. Indeed, to get the initial production of "Kissed" started, Stopkewich borrowed heavily on her 16 credit cards and got a loan from her parents. Grants from various government agencies helped finish the movie, which cost less than $715,000 to make. But the critical success of "Kissed" could soon transfer into financial success for Stopkewich and Parker. SEX, DEATH PAYS Both have signed with the William Morris agency and have received numerous scripts. Stopkewich has been in discussions with Warner Brothers, Miramax and 20th Century Fox. In the near term, Stopkewich, who has been on the road for most of this year promoting the movie, plans to begin work on a new project, which she will not discuss in detail. She also plans to sneak into a public screening of her film to see how a mainstream audience reacts. "I would tell (audiences) to probably forget everything they've read about it and just go into the movie with an open mind," she said. "If they're willing to put aside their preconceived ideas of how the film is going deal with the material then they might be pleasantly surprised."
GCAT	Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko will return home from France on Monday, a senior member of his party said on Friday. Banza Mukalayi, deputy president of Mobutu's Popular Revolutionary Movement MPR, said it was not immediately clear whether the veteran leader would return to the capital Kinshasa or his jungle palace at Gbadolite. "The president is expected back in Zaire on Monday," he told Reuters. Mobutu, who seized power in a 1965 coup, had prostate cancer surgery in Switzerland last August and has spent most of his time in Europe since then, returning only for brief visits. Tutsi-led rebels took up arms in October vowing to topple him. They hold towns and territory in the east and have been pushing steadily west and south.
MCAT	Spot wholesale electricity prices in the northeastern U.S. were mixed Wednesday amid relatively mild temperatures and continued outages at a couple of generating stations in New England. "The weather's been a big factor today," said a New York trader who noted next-day prices in the western portion of the New York Power Pool (NYPP) slipped along with weaker prices at the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnect pool. Temperatures through much of the Northeast were expected to reach maximums in low-30s and mid-40s Fahrenheit and minimums in the 20s-30s on Thursday. In western NYPP, peak, non-firm electricity for Thursday was discussed around $22.50-$23.50 a megawatt hour (MWh), down from Tuesday's assessment of $23.50-$24.50. Off-peak, non-firm for Thursday delivery in western NYPP was again pegged at $14.50-$15.00. In addition a mild weather forecast up to the weekend, next-day prices in western part of the grid could be pressured lower by Thursday's expected startup of the 800 megawatt (MW) Fitzpatrick nuclear power plant in Scriba, N.Y. "You should see prices come off with Fitzpatrick," another New York trader said. In the eastern half of NYPP, peak, non-firm electricity for Thursday was assessed near $29.00/MWh, compared with Tuesday's range of $29.00-$34.00. Thursday non-firm deliveries during light load periods on Thursday were steady at $19.00-$20.00. New England utilities continued to switch on service to customers whose power was cut by a heavy weekend snowstorm. Northeast Utilities (NU) said about 13,900 of its 1.9 million customers were still without electricity early today. The region may have to brace for another storm. The latest forecast showed a so-called "nor'easter" may be developing in the area for late this weekend and into early next week. NU's Public Service of New Hampshire pushed back the restart of its 345 MW Merrimack coal-fired unit 2 to Sunday from Monday. The unit near Bow, N.H., was shut in October for boiler maintenance. After being idled last Thursday for electrical repairs, the 910 MW Maine Yankee plant in Wiscasset, Maine, would likely remain off line until this weekend. In the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL), peak, non-firm electricity for Thursday at the NU border was assessed near $33.00-$35.00, tumbling from Tuesday's $36.50-37.50. Non-firm, off-peak NEPOOL power for Thursday delivery to the NU border was assessed steady at $20.00-$21.00. Swing gas prices at the New York City gate were flat in the $4.06-$4.08 per million British thermal units. In New York harbor, a spot barge of 0.3 percent sulphur residual oil held at $23.00-$23.25 a barrel amid sharply lower crude prices. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, January crude futures closed down $1.12 at $23.30 a barrel. --R Leong, New York Power Desk +1 212 859 1622

ECAT	Bundesbank council member Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher said on Monday that estimates for German tax revenues, due this month, would show Germany's budget deficit at between 3.2 percent and 3.5 percent of GDP. Kuehbacher, also head of the state central bank for Berlin and Brandenburg, said that he expected this figure because of the high level of tax shortfalls and increased social welfare spending. The Maastricht treaty requirees that would-be members of European Economic and Monetary Union aim for budget deficits of no more than three percent of gross domestic product. He said that it was possible that the German government would raise taxes to help German meet the criteria. Kuehbacher also predicted that both Germany and France would miss the Maastricht Treaty debt and deficit goals. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
CCAT	Russia's biggest oil company NK LUKoil is in the process of deciding whether or not to issue a Eurobond, syndicate managers said on Wednesday. "LUKoil is one of the largest Russian companies and they have enormous financing needs," said an emerging market syndicate manager at a U.S. bank in London. "They are getting a number of banks to give them financing ideas, and are considering what funding levels they could achieve in the bond market relative to the syndicated loan market," he said. A syndicate official at another bank said LUKoil had already awarded the mandate for an international bond issue, but declined to give details. "The mandate has already been decided, for a Eurobond and possibly other financings," the official said. "LUKoil is a little bit more advanced than Gazprom at this stage in their plans," he said. Russia's natural gas monopoly Gazprom said earlier in November it planned to target foreign investors with an international bond issue. A slew of Russian borrowers were expected to tap the international bond markets in 1997, following a debut financing for Russia itself which is due later this month. Roadshows for Russia's deal, expected to be for up to $500 million at five years, are being held in 14 cities around the globe in an unprecedented marketing effort. J.P. Morgan and SBC Warburg are joint lead managers on the transaction. "This is an extremely important event and is just the starting gun," Eric Fine, East European bond strategist at Morgan Stanley said in a recent interview. "It will establish a benchmark for future Russian issuance from the corporate sector," he said. Also in line for Eurobonds are the cities of Moscow and St Petersburg. These have been mandated to CS First Boston and Salomon Brothers respectively. -- Aline van Duyn, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7748

"We're worried about stagnating output, the weakness of domestic demand and investments, unemployment levels and the climate of general uncertainty," Fossa added. Figures released earlier this week showed gross domestic product rising by a real 0.7 percent, year-on-year, in the third quarter of 1996. -- Rome newsroom +396 6782501
GCAT	Manny Alexander's RBI-triple scored Carl Everett with the go-ahead run in a three-run ninth inning as the New York Mets rallied for their fourth straight win, defeating the first-place Atlanta Braves 10-7. The scrappy Mets overcame a 5-3 deficit to take a 7-5 lead into the bottom of the eighth by scoring four times in the top half, but reliever Juan Acevedo surrendered the advantage on a home run by Eddie Perez and an RBI-double by Keith Lockhart. New York regained the lead against Mike Bielecki (3-5) in the ninth. Former Braves reliever Greg McMichael (5-6) threw one pitch to get out of the eighth and notched the win. John Franco, who was critical of Atlanta manager Bobby Cox's decision to bypass him for the All-Star Game, struck out the side in the ninth for his 21st save. The Mets (49-38) moved within 7 1/2 games of the defending National League champion Braves in the East, and remained two behind the Florida Marlins in the wildcard race. "This is the team we're trying to chase down," said McMichael. "All the games we win are important. This is where they've (the Braves) made their money, this part of the season." "We just play the game until it's over," said Mets manager Bobby Valentine. In Los Angeles, Chan Ho Park allowed three hits over seven innings and Mike Piazza and Tripp Cromer homered as the Los Angeles Dodgers extended their season-high winning streak to seven games with a 11-0 romp over the San Francisco Giants. The 24-year-old Korean (6-5) walked one and struck out five in winning for the first time in five starts against San Francisco. "I really wanted to beat San Francisco," Park said. "It was very important to get the second half off to a good start." "He was hitting his spots and making his pitches," added Piazza. "That shows that he's learning to pitch." The Dodgers moved to within five games of the first-place Giants in the West. At Florida, the Marlins ruined a late rally by the Philadelphia Phillies with a run in the last of the ninth to take an 8-7 victory. Pinch-hitter Alex Arias's soft liner to left-centre with one out in the ninth scored Bobby Bonilla for the game-winner. Arias, who is 7-for-12 as a pinch-hitter this season, looped a 2-1 pitch into shallow left-centre as Florida broke a three-game losing streak. "You've got to be patient in that situation," said Arias. "I went up there looking for a fastball I can handle. I was not going to swing at a breaking pitch." Philadelphia had tied the game in the ninth with two runs against closer Robb Nen, who blew his sixth save in 30 opportunities. The Phils had drawn within striking range with three runs in the eighth as they overcame a 7-2 deficit. "I commend these guys for their effort," said Phillies manager Terry Francona. "We were down, but put ourselves in the position to win.  We were one hit away.  We're learning, and sometimes that's hard." Philadelphia (24-62) owns the worst record in the majors and have lost 21 of its last 23 games. In Pittsburgh, Darryl Kile pitched a six-hitter for his third shutout of the season and Craig Biggio went 4-for-4 with three RBI as the Houston Astros blanked the Pirates 7-0. Kile (11-3) walked two and struck out seven. It was Biggio's 16th career four-hit game and helped move the Astros into a first-place tie with the Pirates in the National League Central. Jason Schmidt (4-5), coming off consecutive complete games, was tagged for seven runs and nine hits in four-plus innings. He had allowed seven runs in his previous four outings combined. In Chicago, Gary Gaetti capped a 4-for-4, three-RBI day with a homer in the ninth, his second of the game, to lift the St. Louis Cardinals to a 3-2 victory over the Chicago Cubs. Alan Benes (8-7) allowed two runs and five hits over eight innings to earn the win as the Cardinals snapped a four-game losing streak. He walked five and struck out six. Dennis Eckersley pitched a hitless ninth for his 19th save. Gaetti had an RBI single in the first inning and a solo homer in the third before blasting the game-winning homer in the ninth off reliever Turk Wendell (2-4). "Gaetti gets paid to hit and I get paid to pitch," Wendell said. "He won the battle, hitting my slider for a homer." At Colorado, Ken Caminiti hit a pair of three-run homers and drove in six runs as the San Diego Padres handed the Colorado Rockies their seventh straight loss, 11-5. Caminiti homered in the first to stake the Padres to a 3-0 lead and added his eighth homer in the fourth as San Diego opened an 8-3 advantage. Andy Ashby (5-5) allowed five runs and nine hits in six innings to notch the victory for the Padres, who won for the 200th time under manager Bruce Bochy. John Burke (2-5) took the loss.
ECAT	Abolition of trade tariffs between Yugoslavia and Macedonia, effective later this month, could be the first step towards a regional customs union, an independent analyst said on Wednesday. The analyst, Stojan Stamenkovic of the Belgrade Institute of Economic Sciences, told Reuters such moves were essential to overcoming Yugoslavia's isolation under 4-1/2 years of U.N. imposed sanctions. The Federal Information Secretariat in Belgrade announced late on Tuesday that an interstate agreement signed in Skopje early last month will come into effect on October 7. Under the agreement, most goods produced in Yugoslavia and Macedonia will not be subject to customs or non-customs duties. Only strategic agricultural products and livestock from Yugoslavia and certain ferrous metallurgy products, cigarettes, buses, refrigerators and freezers from Macedonia will remain on quotas, said the statement. "This is the first step towards a customs union between Yugoslavia and Macedonia, and later perhaps some other countries in our neighbourhood," Stamenkovic said. Under the agreement, most quotas will be abolished by the end of 1999. The Yugoslav and Macedonian transport ministers, Zoran Vujovic and Dimitar Buzlevski, said the two countries would also work to restore traffic to the main European north-south corridor running through both countries. The United Nations announced late on Tuesday that sanctions against Yugoslavia had been formally removed. -- Amra Kevic, Belgrade newsroom +381 11 2224305

GCAT	Violent thunderstorms and tornadoes ripped across southeastern Michigan on Wednesday afternoon, flooding streets, flipping cars and causing at least one death, according to local officials. In Holly, about 25 miles south of Flint, Mich., one person was reported dead after a tornado struck the Chateau Oak Hills Mobile Home Park, said WWJ-Radio. Colleen Prosyniuk, a spokeswoman for the Oakland County Emergency Management Department, said she could not confirm the death, but said there were reports of heavy damage and several injuries from the scene. "The initial reports were 12 to 15 trailers damaged, some destroyed," she said, adding that utility repair crews had also been called to the scene to shut off ruptured gas mains. The series of fast-moving storms smacked into the greater Detroit metropolitan area shortly before rush hour, triggering tornado alarms and sending residents running for cover. Witnesses quickly reported funnel clouds and tornado touchdowns throughout the area, seriously damaged homes, flooded streets, and downed power lines. In Macomb County north of Detroit another mobile home park was also reportedly hit hard by a tornado. A transformer fire was reported in the northern suburb of Troy, Mich., said Prosyniuk. The initial report from Detroit Edison Co was that 40,000 people had been left without power, although that was expected to rise, a spokeswoman said. By 7 p.m., most of the violent storms had passed east toward Canada and the sun was shining in western parts of the city.

ECAT	International Monetary Fund managing director Michel Camdessus said on Tuesday that his initial impression of India's 1997/98 (April-March) budget was extremely positive. "My first impression is extremely positive," Camdessus told reporters as he arrived in the Indian capital. He was commenting on the Indian government's tax and spending plan which was announced last week.   "It is positive because all the people in this country, in the business community tell me this will help them to do better and contribute better to the overall prosperity of the country," the IMF head said. Indian stock markets have rallied strongly since Finance Minister P. Chidambaram announced the budget, which would slash corporate and personal income tax rates, and bring down import duties on a range of goods. Camdessus arrived in New Delhi from the southwestern state of Goa, where he spent two days following his weekend arrival in the southern city of Madras. He was scheduled to meet Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and Chidambaram on Wednesday before holding a news conference.
GCAT	South Africa's cabinet deferred a decision on a controversial proposed arms sale to Syria to a future meeting, officials said on Wednesday. "These consultations have in fact not yet been concluded and the matter is being held over until a next meeting of cabinet," cabinet secretary Jakes Gerwel told a news conference, adding that the decision would not necessarily be taken when the cabinet met again in two weeks' time.   The cabinet had already given provisional approval to the sale, according to leaked cabinet minutes, pending the approval of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. South Africa says it is just one of several countries, including three unnamed European states, which are bidding for the $650 million contract. It also asserts that a U.S. defence contractor is involved in at least one of those bids. The Pretoria government was angered by a U.S. threat to cut off aid over the proposed deal to provide tank-gun aiming systems to the Damascus government, which Washington regards as a state sponsor of terrorism. Syria denies it supports terrorists. The electronic system provides computerised control of the mechanism that aims and fires the cannon in tanks and howitzers, making them many times more accurate -- something that has raised fears in Syria's arch-foe and neighbour, Israel.

The placement price is at a discount of about 3.8 percent to its last transacted price of S$2.08 each on June 5, 1997, a company statement said. Pacific Century, which has a wide ranging interest including insurance, manufacturing and property, said the net proceeds will amount to S$30.15 million.   They will be used for funding the acquisition and development costs of the Nation Wealth Plaza in Beijing, China, a retail, commercial and residential project currently under construction. The issue will increase the company's consolidated net tangible asset value of each share to S$1.49 from S$1.44. -- Singapore newsroom (65 8703080)

GCAT	Taiwan's foreign minister has visited Belgium on a confidential diplomatic mission, the mass-circulation United Daily News reported on Sunday. The newspaper said foreign minister John Chang flew to Brussels on Saturday following a visit to South Africa, where he sought to reverse Pretoria's November 27 decision to switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taipei. Communist China regards Taiwan as a renegade province following a civil war which split them in 1949. "I can clearly say (the visit) is not related to discussing forging diplomatic ties with certain countries," Chang was quoted as saying. "But considering my position, you can say it's related to diplomatic interests." Chang, however, described his visit in Belgium as private. "There will be no official visit...," he was quoted as saying by telephone from Brussels. Chang said he had postponed his return to Taipei on Tuesday or Wednesday. He was originally scheduled to return on Sunday. Vice-foreign minister Cheng Chien-jen said on Saturday Chang had left South Africa and was visiting other countries, but he declined to give more details. "Minister Chang is going out, striving to strengthen our relations with other countries," Cheng said on Taiwan state television. South African President Nelson Mandela announced last month that Pretoria, the biggest of Taiwan's only 30 diplomatic allies, would switch ties to Beijing in 1997. Chang met Mandela on Wednesday but the South African president said he would stick by his "agonising decision" to sever ties with Taiwan. Chang said on Thursday that Taipei would recall its ambassador to South Africa and immediately suspend all aid projects and treaties in protest of Pretoria's decision.
GCAT	Ecuadoran student protests against big rises in the cost of public services ended in violence on Tuesday, as police fired tear gas at demonstrators around Quito's Central University. "Two people were wounded. Someone fired and a young man was wounded in the arm, while another was hit in the eye by a tear gas canister," a Reuters photographer on the scene said. The students were protesting against increases in electricity, telephone, gas and transport charges announced by President Abdala Bucaram as part of an austerity plan. Ecuadoran unions said on Monday they were considering a general strike on Feb. 5 against Bucaram's tough economic reforms, which include scrapping subsidies to public services. Domestic gas prices have shot up by 250 percent and electricity by more than 100 percent. Bus fares have doubled and telephone rates have also increased substantially. Opposition parties are considering forming a united front against the tariff rises and a planned currency convertibility programme that would peg the sucre to the U.S. dollar.
CCAT	Brazil produced 193,081 vehicles in April, up 33.02 percent over the same month last year, Brazil's Motor Manufactures Association (Anfavea) said. A spokesman for Anfavea said April production was also 12.16 percent higher over March 1997, when 172,151 vehicles were produced. In the first four months of the year, Brazil produced 653,719 vehicles, up 21.82 percent over the same period last year, he said. Last month, automakers sold 156,689 vehicles in Brazil, 30.83 percent more than the 119,767 vehicles sold in April 1996. April sales also rose 8.90 when compared to the previous month, when 143,877 vehicles were sold in the domestic market, he said. Brazil vehicle exports rose to 35,709 vehicles last month, up 77.49 percent over exports in April 1996, which were 20,119 vehicles, he added.

GCAT	Peace talks on Northern Ireland hit a new stumbling block on Monday but their chairman, former U.S. senator George Mitchell, vowed to continue his efforts. Hardline pro-British leader Ian Paisley demanded expulsion of two parties linked to so-called "Loyalist" guerrillas, throwing a new cloud over negotiations that Britain and Ireland say offer the region its best prospects of peace for decades. A decision on the two parties, which, like Paisley, favour a continued British presence in Northern Ireland, was put on hold when Mitchell adjourned plenary negotiations until Tuesday. Paisley is concerned their continued presence could pave the way for Sinn Fein, political wing of the IRA guerrilla group which resumed a fight against British rule in February after a 17 month truce, to take part in the talks. Sinn Fein have been refused seats at the talks until the IRA renews its ceasefire. In line with agreed procedures, Mitchell gave the parties and the British and Irish governments time to consider Paisley's complaint. Heading into the opening session after a one-month summer recess, Mitchell dismissed rumours that he was considering resigning as chairman. "No, that is completely untrue," he told reporters when asked about reports that he would pull out of the talks unless progress is made on how to disarm Irish Catholic and pro-British Protestant guerrilla groups. The talks have failed to tackle a single substantive issue since they began in June and have turned into a replay of the Protestant-Catholic rivalry at the root of the conflict. Mitchell said he was happy to be back and stressed his commitment to the talks, aimed at ending communal distrust after a 25-year guerrilla war which killed more than 3,000 people. "When I accepted the invitation of the (British and Irish) to participate in these talks, I accepted enthusiastically because I believed the talks represent an historic opportunity for the people of Northen Ireland. That is still my view," Mitchell said in a statement. Paisley handed Mitchell what the cleric-politician termed as "an indictment" of the smaller Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) and the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), the political wings of the banned Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Volunteer Force. Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), was angry because the parties have failed to condemn a threat by pro-British guerrillas to kill convicted Protestant activist Billy Wright, who opposes their participation in the talks. Wright says the talks could lead to an all-Ireland state against the wishes of the British region's Protestant majority. "We as a party are not prepared to continue at the table until this matter is resolved," Paisley told reporters. PUP and UDP leaders brushed aside Paisley's protests and said they were committed to peace. "There is nothing in it which we believe is an indictment," commented Billy Hutchinson, head of the PUP.

ECAT	The Thai cabinet on Wednesday approved a finance ministry proposal to increase excise taxes on nine product and service items, a decision that will help raise funds to offset falling government tax revenue, Excise Department Director General Somchai Ruechupan said. Somchai told reporters the tax hike will give the government an additional 7.74 billion baht ($298 million) of tax revenue a year.   Somchai said the tax hikes, ranging from two to 10 percent and expected to be effective this week, covers imported motorcycles, batteries, marble and granite products, beverages, chandeliers, crystal ware, air-conditioners, and a horse race excise levy. The central bank and finance ministry have said Thailand's sharply slowing economy will likely give the government its first budget deficit in a decade during the 1996/1997 (October/September) fiscal year.

GCAT	Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai will visit Jordan on Tuesday for talks with King Hussein on Middle East peace and military cooperation between the two countries, an Israeli diplomat said on Sunday. Embassy spokesman Shalom Tourgeman said Mordechai and King Hussein would discuss "the peace process as a whole, bilateral issues...and military cooperation". He said they would also discuss security at crossing points on their common borders. Mordechai's visit to Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state in 1994, follows increased Arab-Israeli tension after Israel announced it would build settlements in Arab East Jerusalem and pull back from just nine percent of the West Bank in the first of three planned withdrawals. King Hussein met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Amman two weeks ago but failed to dissuade him from going ahead with plans to build 6,500 Jewish homes in Jabal Abu Ghneim, captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Tourgeman said Mordechai would also meet Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti, Crown Prince Hassan and acting chief of staff Mohammad al-Huwayan.
MCAT	U.S. West Coast light crude prices ended trade by tracking West Texas Intermediate (WTI) spot crudes lower Wednesday, while buyers and sellers avoided trades until the prompt February barrel trade ends. Traders said they saw no immediate pressure from a overnight fire at Tosco Avon's hydrocracker. The fire-damaged unit, which makes gasoline and has a capacity of 32,000 barrels-per-day, sent California wholesale gasoline prices up about two cents a gallon Wednesday. BP America continued to offer February Alaskan crude barrels at $1.25 off the February spot crude index.   Some buyers claimed most refiners were well supplied for January and February. BP said they would decline to offer February barrels off March NYMEX. Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude fell 40 cents on the day to $22.77/22.97 a barrel, as sliding as much as 65 cents earlier amid perceived ample crude supply. Meanwhile, the market for California heavy crudes stood between 25 cents under and postings. Interprovincial Pipeline on Wednesday set apportionment at two percent for all its crude oil pipelines to Superior, Wisconsin from Edmonton, Alberta.

MCAT	Yen-based Tokyo precious metal futures ended mostly weaker on Monday, following sharp losses in New York on Friday, traders said. Activity was lacklustre as most private investors retreated to the sidelines amid uncertainty over near-term direction in the currency market, the traders said. Gold futures ranged from five yen to eight yen per gram lower. Most-active benchmark February was off six yen at 1,355 yen. Spot gold was quoted at $349.40/70 per ounce at the Tokyo close, against $348.30/80 in New York on Friday.   Although moderate buying in gold futures by private investors were detected, bearish sentiment toward spot gold remained, the traders said. "In addition to the spectre of Swiss gold sales, the firmness in the U.S. stock market undermined sentiment toward gold," a trading house trader said. Platinum futures ended mostly weaker, but off early lows, backed by a recovery in spot platinum prices. In platinum futures, mixed trade was detected as trading was basically directionless. Benchmark February platinum was off four yen at 1,451 yen.   Palladium futures opened firmer, but profit taking by private investors sent most prices into negative territory by the close, they said. Fading fears of a strike at Russian producer Norilsk were cited as a bearish factor, while the ongoing suspension of Russian exports of platinum group metals to Japan limited price losses, the traders said. Japanese traders expected no shipments in April from Russia, and said traders would continue to buy palladium in the spot market. Benchmark February palladium was off four yen at 562 yen. -- Tokyo Commodity Desk +81-3-3432-7431

ECAT	South Korea's central bank on Thursday released details of cuts in reserve requirements to an average of 5.5 percent from 7.4 percent. A Bank of Korea statement said local banks would have to set aside between two and seven percent of their deposits under the new requirements, effective from November 8, against the current reserve ratios of between three and nine percent.   The move is aimed at making local banks more competitive and creating conditions for lower interest rates, the statement said. The central bank said the excess liquidity caused by the reserve requirement cuts would be absorbed by lowering the ceiling in its rediscount activities with local banks. The ceiling would be cut to 6.4 trillion won from the current 9.2 trillion won. The reserve requirement cuts are expected to improve the profitability of local banks by a total of 150 billion won, it said.   Reserve requirement for time deposits for two years or more will be lowered to four percent from six percent, the central bank said. The requirement for savings deposits, overdraft and time deposits for less then two years will be cut by two percentage points to seven percent. Local banks would have to set aside two percent of other deposits with incentives offered by the government to encourage savings, instead of the current three percent.
GCAT	Leftist rebels killed about 50 security force members in the latest round of fighting and hit-and-run attacks across Colombia, military sources said on Saturday. They said the flurry of apparently closely coordinated guerrilla attacks, which began late on Friday, marked the worst rebel offensive in more than a year and government troops had been placed on a maximum state of alert nationwide. The worst attack occurred on Saturday when about 100 suspected Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels overran the Las Delicias military base on the border between jungle-covered Caqueta and Putumayo provinces in the country's southwest, Defence Ministry sources said. They said about 20 soldiers had been killed in the attack. Other punishing strikes on military and police targets included a rare rebel foray into the southern outskirts of the capital, Bogota, where five policemen were killed and three others wounded in a series of rocket and dynamite attacks on Friday night, Gen. Euclides Sanchez Vargas, commander of the 13th Army Brigade, told reporters. At least seven soldiers were killed, meanwhile, in heavy fighting on Saturday between government troops and FARC rebels in the municipality of Mesetas in eastern Meta province. Four members of the National Police Force were killed in another rebel attack in northern Santander province, but the death toll was expected to rise there since a dozen policemen were still officially listed as "missing" late on Saturday, hours after the attack occurred. At least a dozen other security force members were reported killed in rebel attacks on several towns in Cundinamarca province, of which Bogota is the capital, in the central coffee-growing province of Tolima, in Magdalena to the north and Guaviare and Valle del Cauca to the south. The mayor of the small town of Susa in Cundinamarca was among the victims of an attack there overnight. All told the Caracol radio network reported late on Saturday that more than 60 soldiers and police had been killed in guerrilla attacks over the previous 24 hours. In addition to the FARC military sources said National Liberation Army (ELN) members were participating in the latest wave of violent attacks across the country. The FARC and ELN, Colombia's largest and oldest guerrilla groups, have been fighting to topple the government since the mid-1960s.
GCAT	A 3-year-old California girl suffered face and neck wounds when she was mauled by a coyote in the backyard of a house on Monday, police said. Lauren Bridges was playing in the snow in the backyard of the house in South Lake Tahoe, a town 180 miles (290 kms) east of San Francisco, when the attack happened, authorities said. The girl's family, from Carmichael, near Sacramento, was visiting the town, which is close to Sierra Nevada ski resorts. The girl's father, Steve Bridges, who was inside the house, heard screaming from the backyard. Looking out of the window, he saw his daughter being swung around by the coyote, a police statement said. Bridges ran outside and grabbed the coyote by the neck. The animal let go of the girl and Bridges carried her inside. When police officer Mark Allen, responding to an emergency call, arrived at the house, he saw the coyote still in the driveway. The coyote ran at Allen and the officer shot the animal in the chest, killing it. Police said Lauren Bridges had multiple puncture wounds about the face and neck and cuts to her lower lip. She was taken to a local hospital where a nursing supervisor said she was in stable condition. The dead coyote was taken away by an officer of the El Dorado Humane Society which planned to have the carcass tested for rabies. Coyote attacks on humans are "pretty unusual", a South Lake Tahoe police spokesman said.
GCAT	What was once a loophole in the campaign laws has become "a four-lane highway full of Brink's (armored) trucks," Newsweek said on Sunday in an article on the "money-for-access game" in the Democratic and Republican parties. Probing the "soft money" loophole that allows contributions to parties instead of individual candidates, the magazine said that "raising tons of campaign cash from special interests is a bipartisan sin -- and it's only getting worse." In an article examining contributions to Bob Dole and the Republicans and to President Bill Clinton and the Democrats, the magazine said, "Money is pouring into American politics in record amounts. Some is legal, some is turning out to be illegal and almost all takes the form of officially sanctioned bribery that can't be squared with basic ethics." The magazine will be available on newsstands on Monday. The "soft money" loophole in the campaign finance law allows contributions to parties instead of to individual candidates, Newsweek said. But in practice, party leaders and campaigns "extract money from high-rollers not in explicit exchange for government favours but for access -- for 'face time' with powerful politicians." "Dole is trying hard to convince voters of Clinton's 'sleaze factor,'" said Newsweek, but he "needs to be careful about coming down too hard on money from abroad." One of Dole's biggest financial backers, according to Newsweek, is sugar magnate Jose Fanjul, a Cuban citizen who lives in Florida and holds a Spanish passport. It also reported a Cuban-American drug kingpin, Jorge Cabrera, visited the White House for a reception and attended a dinner with Vice President Al Gore in Miami's exclusive Cocaplum section after he gave $20,000 to the Democratic National Committee last November. Cabrera was later busted for importing 5,828 pounds of cocaine through Cuba, Newsweek said. "But even as the DNC scrambles to return Cabrera's check, the Democrats face an embarrassing new problem. Cabrera is in jail, and law-enforcement officials say the $20,000 almost certainly comes from drug-trafficking." The Clinton White House, working through the DNC, "has perfected the art of auctioning off access," the article said. "Though they still trail (Republicans) in soft money and cash-on-hand for the late-October stretch run, the Democrats -- embracing corporate interests they once shunned -- are catching up." Still, added Newsweek: "Dole's overall record makes him a poor candidate to be criticising cosiness with special interests. As chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, he routinely took money from interests with legislation under his jurisdiction." The best chances for reform of campaign funding are neither with public financing nor total deregulation, Newsweek said, but in compromise. Quoting Theodore Roosevelt, the magazine concludes, "It is necessary that laws should be passed to prohibit the use of corporate funds directly or indirectly for political purposes."
GCAT	A retired Brazilian police officer shot his 25-year-old son to death after being criticised for flirting with a woman in front of his grandchildren, a police spokesman said on Tuesday. He said Orlando Costa Jr. was shot eight times in front of other family members and friends on Sunday at his Rio de Janeiro home, and died shortly after at a hospital. "I know you kill, you don't have to shoot anymore," a friend of the family quoted Costa as saying in Jornal do Brasil after his father had shot him in the knee. The father, 47, whose name is also Orlando Costa, escaped from the house in his car and was still at large, the police spokesman said.
CCAT	South Africa's Grinaker Construction Ltd (Grinacon), which will list on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange next month, will embark on an offshore expansion drive over the next three years to underpin earnings growth. Grinacon managing director Bean Bornheimer said late on Thursday the company, which was recently unbundled from Grinaker Holdings Ltd , aims to grow international operations to 20 percent of turnover by the year 2000 from eight percent now. He said work opportunities were being investigated in southern and central Africa as well as South East Asia. "We are looking at southern and central Africa as a growth market. A lot of these countries are getting support from the World Bank and civil engineering opportunities are opening up," Bornheimer said addressing an investment analysts meeting. He said Grinacon had recently landed two contracts in Malaysia to build concrete sleepers. "We are thinking of investing seven to 10 million rand there to produce sleepers." In a bid to widen its margins from 2.8 percent in the 1995/96 financial year to an expected 4.5 percent within three years, Grinacon would also focus on growing its building products division and the services it offers to opencast mining operations. Bornheimer said he was not very optimistic about the outlook for South Africa's building industry in 1997 as hotel construction was currently at its peak. However, some construction could be sparked by the expected awarding of gambling licences from March next year. He said a huge boon for the industry would be if Cape Town was awarded the 2004 Olympic Games, where construction work would be worth an estimated seven billion rand. Grinacon, which will be listed in the JSE's building and construction sector on December 2, was unbundled from its parent to enable it to trade at prices closer to the underlying value of its business, Bornheimer said. In the year to June 30 Grinacon achieved profit before tax of 41 million rand off turnover of 1.9 billion rand. Earnings per share rose to 81.2 cents from 85.6 the previous year, with the dividend up to 18 cents from 15. -- Nicole Mordant, Johannesburg newsroom 27 11 482 1003
GCAT	Alarmed by reports of armed gangs terrorising the countryside, Guatemala's President on Wednesday reopened army bases closed recently under terms of a peace treaty ending a 36-year civil war. President Alvaro Arzu told reporters he was ordering some military bases be used for joint police-army crime fighting operations. "We are going to reinstall some of the bases in a joint operation with the National Civilian Police so that these joint forces can act against delinquency," Arzu said. Under terms of the peace accords signed by the government and leftist rebels in December, the army relinquished its role as internal security police. The military also cut its ranks by one third and closed several army bases that had been used during three decades of counter-insurgency campaigns against the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit (URNG). Arzu said criminals have taken advantage of the closing of bases and were acting in areas that used to be military zones. For several months armed criminal gangs, sometimes dressed in olive green, have been reported in assaults, attacks on farms to steal payroll cash, and roadblocks to rob motorists. The reports have come from the northern department of Quiche and in various places along the Southwestern Pacific coast. Business groups say the gangs could be former guerrillas who did not disarm during demobilization. But left wing Congressman Amilcar Mendez has pointed the finger at former soldiers and members of paramilitary groups that worked for the army during the war. Defence Minister Hector Barrios has made repeated public statements that the armed gangs are common criminals not related to any military or revolutionary group.
MCAT	Bombay shares closed lower in sluggish trade as the market awaited key political developments for direction, brokers said. Absence of clear picture about efforts to put together a new coalition after prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda was defeated in parliamentary vote overnight hit trading volumes, they said. "People sat out on the sidelines after a flurry at the start," said Bharat Dalal, a partner at brokerage Sanat Dalal. The market was held together by hopes a widely welcomed budget would be approved and bickering politicians would sort out their differences to avert a snap poll.   Prashant Purker, head of institutional sales at Peregrine Capital India, said the market was already largely discounting the optimistic scenario, of a passed budget and new coalition. Dalal said there was no threat to the market so long as there was assurance of a government and continuity of policies. "The market's waiting for definite direction," said Sanjeev Choithani at brokerage Pashupati Advani. "If a coalition emerges quickly it could take the market up 100-150 points." He said there were buyers at the day's lower levels which indicated that a downside could be limited.   Foreign investors were disturbed by the political developments but will not dump shares, analysts said. "I don't see a major sell-off," said Bharat Iyer, market strategist at UBS Securities, the investment arm of Union Bank of Switzerland. He said foreign investors put money into Indian stocks because of the long-term growth story and were unlikely to get out due to short-term political instability. But fresh purchases would slow until the picture became clearer or till valuations became more attractive. --Ranjit Gangadharan, Bombay equities +91-22-265-9000
MCAT	Caracas stocks rose in moderate trade led by national telephone company CANTV shares that surged 4.5 percent on better than expected year end earnings figures, traders said. "CANTV dominated trade ... investors are feeling optimistic, especially abroad," said Intervalores broker Ricardo Marino. CANTV shares ignored a wider sell-off among other U.S. listed Latin American issues on comments by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan questioning the sustainability of the U.S. stock market's rise. CANTV shares rose 98.00 bolivars, closing at 2259.00.   CANTV reported Wednesday morning net profits of 208 billion bolivars. That translated into earnings of some $3.07 per American Depository Receipt (ADR), traders said, exceeding consensus forecasts of around $2.73. "The company's looking good," said Bancaracas broker William Boulton. The bolsa's 19-share  index rose 1.13 percent on the day to close at 6,681.17 as 26 million shares traded worth 3.8 billion bolivars ($8.1 million).

Fino, whose national unity government is trying to restore order after weeks of armed unrest, will hold talks with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi in Rome after European Union foreign ministers meet in Brussels to work out an aid mission. The two leaders will also talk about the effect on Italy of an exodus of nearly 11,000 Albanian refugees who have fled across the Adriatic on a flotilla of rusty ships. Italy landed a first shipment of medical aid in the southern Albanian port of Vlore on Sunday and is expected to fly in further supplies to Tirana on Monday. Albania wants police units from abroad to help secure ports, airport, roads and railways so that relief supplies can be distributed. Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said in Rome on Sunday that it might be necessary for Italy to help control the Albanian ports from which the refugees are leaving. This would need Albanian permission. Italy said Albanians who would be in danger if they returned home or who needed medical care could stay temporarily but others, particularly those considered a threat to public safety, would have to return. Italy has already repatriated several hundred "undesirables", including prisoners who escaped from Albanian jails in the chaos and refugees who broke the law after their arrival. The EU foreign ministers in Brussels will work out a plan for security measures to help the humanitarian relief mission. Dini said European humanitarian aid to Albania was urgently needed but a military operation was "not opportune". However, the aid would need a protection force because it might end up in the hands of armed bandits. The EU has already turned down an Albanian request for large-scale military intervention to help restore order after rebels looted weapons from army depots and rose against President Sali Berisha, whom they blame for failed savings schemes that bankrupted thousands. Berisha dismissed the rebels' demands for his resignation, saying in an interview published on Sunday: "I will not submit to blackmail, I will not let myself be frightened by the threat of arms." The president has promised to quit if his party loses new elections to be held by June. In Vlore, Italian helicopters brought in nearly two tonnes of medical aid on Sunday in an operation organised by rebel councils now running southern towns, and the Italian government. "We are happy such an operation was successful because we badly needed medical equipment," local hospital director Servet Kojdheli told Reuters. The Interior Ministry announced on Sunday that the northern port of Durres, 40 km (25 miles) west of Tirana, had reopened. It closed in chaos last week as thousands of Albanians tried to flee in barely seaworthy ships. In Tirana, several hundred people, many of them mothers with their children, staged a demonstration to demand an end to unrest. They held up placards saying "Stop violence and weapons" and "Give the children books, not guns".
GCAT	The chairman of the Senate Labor Committee announced Monday he will hold a March 18 hearing to consider the long-stalled nomination of Alexis Herman as secretary of labor. Herman, selected by President Clinton, was director of the White House office of public outreach. Her nomination has been languishing due to Republican concerns about her possible involvement in questionable Democratic fundraising. Republicans have questioned Herman's role in a May White House coffee for bankers that was attended by Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has met with Herman to discuss the issue. Lott has said in the past Herman's nomination appeared to be in some difficulty. But last week he said he believed Herman will "still likely be confirmed." Labor Committee Chairman James Jeffords, a Vermont Republican, had requested additional information about Herman's activities.
CCAT	Companhia Paulista de Forca e Luz (CPFL), considered the jewel of Brazil's power sector, expects another strong performance this year due to rising sales and cost-cutting ahead of its privatization slated for August. "We will continue to show profits in 1997 but how much depends on electric rates," CPFL Financial Director Julio Netto told Reuters in an interview.   The Sao Paulo-based firm, a unit of state-owned Cesp record net profit for 1996 after showing a loss of 51 million reais ($48.8 million) the prior year, he said. "Last year's results will be the best in CPFL's history," Netto said. The rising trend is expected to continue this year but will hinge on a rate adjustment expected to be announced in February or March, he said.   Founded 83 years ago by English immigrants, CPFL has assets of 2.5 billion reais ($2.39 billion) and is viewed as a gem among Sao Paulo state power utilities slated to be sold off over the next two years. Boosted by its privatization prospects, CPFL preferred stock jumped 265 percent to 94.90 reais last year and closed Monday at 100 reais. During the interview, conducted last Friday, Netto declined to divulge the firm's 1996 net profit, citing Brazilian Securities Commission disclosure rules which require the market be notified first.   But market analysts expect CPFL will likely post a roughly 100 million reais profit, boosted by higher rates, rising sales and a pre-privatization restructuring of the firm. "A 21 percent increase in power rates in the end of 1995, sales growth of roughly 5 percent and cuts in expenses helped the company to post a good result in 1996," Netto said. CPFL posted record nine-month earnings of 71 million reais. Full-year earnings are due out in March. For this year, company results are expected to grow more as power sales are forecast to rise between four and five percent.   Netto said a possible electric rate adjustments of between seven and ten percent in 1997's first quarter would determine how much earnings could grow this year. CPFL attractiveness lies in its wealthy operating area in Sao Paulo state's centre-north region, which is made up of 225 municipalities including Campinas and Ribeirao Preto. The area's per-capita income of $5,500 a year is well above Brazil's average of $3,000.   "The CPFL market of 7.5 million people is very attractive," Netto said, adding power demand is expected to swell in the next two years as many industrial firms build new plants in the region. Over the last eight years, CPFL sales have grown an average five percent a year, reaching 1.12 billion reais in 1995. Moreover, CPFL has little debt compared with other state-run power firms, accounting for 32 percent of its 1.9 billion-reais net worth, and one of the best productivity levels among Brazil's electric utilities.   CPFL's electricity losses were just 5.9 percent of total sales in 1996 versus 27 percent of sales at Rio de Janeiro Next month, Sao Paulo state is expected to announce the names of two consultants which will make a financial evaluation of the firm and draw up a privatization model for CPFL. Meanwhile, the firm will continue its ongoing restructuring plan, which includes cutting 400 workers to reduce its payroll to 6,100 employees by August, Netto said. 1.00 reais o $1.0445 ((-- Sao Paulo newsroom, 5511 248 5415))
GCAT	Boris Yeltsin was Russia's "Invisible Man" for eight of the past 12 months -- the first year of his second term in the Kremlin. But when the president finally re-emerged from heart surgery and pneumonia, his transformation to a would-be "Invincible Man" delighted reformers at home and amazed the outside world. It has become commonplace to say Yeltsin is a fighter. Yet it is still true, with a new twist. His quintuple heart bypass operation last November taught him to value time. A year ago this Thursday, he was elected against the odds for his second and constitutionally last term. For the lack of a serious opponent inside the country, the Russian president is directing his energies towards fighting for a better Russia and for his own place in history -- as if there were no tomorrow. Yeltsin said in his State of the Nation address in March he wanted to see Russians proud of their state in four years' time and he seems to be putting his all into achieving this end. The remaining three years in office should show whether his new vigour, health permitting, can last and, more importantly, bring results. A PRESIDENT RUNNING AGAINST THE CLOCK His biggest immediate worry is the economy. He is adding his political clout to a relatively youthful "Dream Team" government of reformers fighting a looming financial crisis. So far, Yeltsin's actions for the last four months since emerging in February from a series of illnesses are so composed, focused and energetic that the 66-year-old Kremlin leader looks like a man who is running against the clock. "Boris Nikolayevich has set off on his last political race and has finished the first stage," said the influential Itogi current affairs weekly magazine. He has put in place a government powered by young and competent reformers, ended the war in Chechnya and scored several diplomatic successes. His physical energy seems at times limited but his mental alertness generally appears unwavering. Before July 3, when he defeated Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov by 10 million votes, Yeltsin had done the impossible. After two bouts of heart problems in 1995 and haunted by bloodshed in rebel Chechnya -- a war which he unleashed himself and now bitterly regrets -- Yeltsin looked a physical wreck and a political corpse by February 1996 when he decided to run for a second term. But an energetic meet-the-people campaign orchestrated by liberal Anatoly Chubais and his team took him across Russia dancing the twist and even playing on a children's swing. His younger daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, became an informal image-builder. She was given the post officially on Monday. YELTSIN COMES CLEAN OVER HEART TROUBLES Yeltsin's health failed him in late June, but the voters were not to know that. On July 3, Yeltsin did not turn up at his usual polling station, leaving the world media gathered there guessing what was wrong. His aides' explanations variously included Yeltsin losing his voice in vigorous first-round campaigning, a cold, a sore throat and bronchitis. It was Yeltsin himself who decided to "come clean". He told the country in September he had decided to go under the knife to be able to return to active life. He had heart surgery on November 5. As he was recovering, he suffered double pneumonia in January and it was only in February that he returned, amazingly transformed, to active duty. "During the last year Boris Yeltsin has turned into an energetic old man, in good form, from a bulky and unhealthy, ageing man," Itogi said. Yeltsin's track record since February is impressive. Reformers inside Russia and his backers and potential investors elsewhere in the world can only hope for this to last. BELARUS THE KEY TO POWER BEYOND 2000? Enthused by his performance, Kremlin analysts are even looking into ways for Yeltsin to stay in power beyond 2000. The constitution says he cannot run for a third term but some experts say that, if integration between Russia and neighbouring Belarus produces a single state, Yeltsin may have the right to stand for the presidency in the new country. He has largely scrapped his trademark policy of having several centres of power, hawks and liberals, in his own camp. He has concentrated on backing ministers despite opposition from the largely hostile State Duma lower house of parliament. Having huge constitutional powers, Yeltsin does not need to be concerned about the chance of a repeat of a power struggle with parliament which resulted in bloody riots and government tanks shelling the White House parliament building in 1993. He can also afford not to worry too much about his popularity rating. The latest poll by the respected VTsIOM research centre gave Yeltsin a mere 5.5 percent backing, far behind Zyuganov who led the field with 17 percent. His real worry is the economy and his government will need all its skill and a dose of good luck to achieve a breakthrough. ECONOMY SHOWS FIRST SIGNS OF GROWTH The economy, in decline since 1989, is showing the first signs of growth this year, and could be roaring ahead like an Asian tiger by the turn of the century. Inflation is heading for 12 percent this year, down from triple digits 15 months ago. But a financial crisis is looming and the cabinet is taking desperate steps to increase state revenues and cut spending. To do that, some of the measures like a new tax code and the 1998 budget based on the code must be approved by the uncooperative Duma. Some experts predict a "hot autumn" of battles between the government and parliament after the summer break. It is just the kind of challenge the "new" Yeltsin is likely to relish.
GCAT	Ghana's Jerry Rawlings, who won a second four-year presidential term on Wednesday, has built a political career spanning close to two decades largely on charisma and showmanship. Already assured a place in history books by being the first African to seize power in two successful coups, Rawlings chalked up another record by becoming the first incumbent to be re-elected since Ghana won independence in 1957. Others were toppled by the military before serving out their term. National Election Commission chairman Kwadwo Afari-Gyan told a news conference Rawlings had won 57.2 percent of votes cast against 39.9 percent for his main rival John Kufuor of the opposition's Great Alliance. This gives him a final four-year term. Rawlings won praise in international financial circles for dragging the country out of ruin and into economic growth. Despite his regime's leftist stance after he took power in 1981, he ruthlessly pushed through economic austerity measures in the 1980s. Ghana was held up as a model for Africa by the World Bank and Western donors. Opponents called him a dictator and said he had the worst human rights record of any Ghanaian leader since independence from Britain in 1957. A showman and passionate advocate of the rights of the poor, he built a popular following throughout West Africa. This unsettled the region's older civilian and military leaders until they were persuaded he had no plans to export his "revolution." Flight-Lieutenant Rawlings resigned from the air force only a few weeks before the November 1992 elections in which he won 58 percent of votes to defeat three other contenders. Opposition parties alleged that Rawlings rigged his victory and boycotted parliamentary elections in December 1992. Rawlings was born in Accra on June 22, 1947, the son of a Scottish retail chemist and a mother from Ghana's Ewe tribe. At the time Ghana was a British colony called the Gold Coast. After school he enrolled in the Ghana military academy at Teshie and was commissioned as a pilot officer in 1969. Rawlings first won world attention on June 4, 1979, when at the age of 31 he overthrew General Fred Akuffo and formed an all-ranks Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC). Within days three former military heads of state, including Akuffo, had been executed for alleged "economic sabotage" and personal enrichment while in office. Special tribunals jailed senior officers, civil servants and businessmen -- one for 150 years -- for plundering the economy. The AFRC kept its promise to hold free elections once the "house-cleaning" was finished and stepped down in favour of the elected civilian government of President Hilla Limann in September 1979. The economy, based on cash crops like cocoa whose prices on world markets were plunging, continued to deteriorate. Limann was accused of watching impotently as politicians and businessmen reforged corrupt alliances, broken up by the AFRC. On December 31, 1981, a group of Libyan-trained troops set out to overthrow the government, enlisting Rawlings' support. Rawlings became chairman of the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC). Limann was detained, the constitution suspended, parliament dissolved, and political parties banned. The PNDC ran Ghana with a mixture of leftist rhetoric and hard-nosed economic reform until Rawlings transformed himself to civilian leader through the 1992 elections. He is married to childhood sweetheart Nana Konadu Agyeman, a member of the Ashanti royal family. They have a son and three daughters.
GCAT	Fear of a landslide win by Britain's opposition Labour Party could provide the Liberal Democrats with a last-minute boost in the May 1 election, a leading pollster said on Monday. "Increasingly the electorate will be conscious that Labour looks to have a landslide and the British public dont like landslides," Robert Worcester, chairman of the MORI political research organisation told Reuters. If public opinion polls are to be believed, Tony Blair's Labour party could form the next government with a massive majority in the House of Commons of more than 150 seats. With just 11 days to go to the election there is no significant narrowing of the opinion poll gap between the two major parties. But Worcester reckons this prospect might make voters who could otherwise switch from the Conservatives think again. "This group has been telling pollsters it's their intention to vote Labour. What they really want is to get the Tory government out of office and John Major replaced," he said. "Increasingly they are confident they will get what they want and this opens up their options." Some could switch support to Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats, according to Worcester. "Some will realise that voting Liberal Democrat is not a wasted vote but a double vote. They can vote this government out and at the same time vote against a labour landslide," he said. The Liberal Democrats, who analysts say have thin support spread across the whole country, are unlikely to win the number of seats that would reflect their national vote under Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system. Worcester is one of the political experts who takes part in Reuters survey on the outcome of the election. The results of this week's poll will be published on Wednesday April 23 at 0930 GMT. -- London Newsroom, +44 171 542 7958
CCAT	Shipping losses were slightly better in the third quarter than in the first half of the year, but marine insurers said on Monday that the trend is still downwards. The Institute of London Underwriters(ILU) said 22 vessels over 500 gross tons (gt) were lost in the third quarter, amounting to total losses of more than 211,933 gt. It brings the total of ships lost in the first nine months of 1996 to 75. The biggest losses were the 74,278 gt bulk carrier Iolcos Victory, which sank in bad weather off the coat of South Africa with her cargo and four crew, and the 20,884 gt livestock carrier Uniceb, lost in August after an engine room fire. Both ships were insured for $20 million each. But the most expensive loss this year was the two-year-old containership Nedloyd Recife (16,915gt) which broke up after grounding near the Brazilian coast. She was insured for around USD40 million, the ILU said. An ILU spokesman said on Monday: " On balance, the outlook for the full 12 months is not encouraging." "Both the ships and tonnage lost totals will rise due to subsequent confirmations as some major casualties are settled by underwriters. Moreover the last quarter of the year tends to produce heavier casualties," he said. The figure for ships lost for the first nine months of last year rose from 64 to 81 by the time later confirmations were added, the ILU said. The number of people reported lost or missing in the first nine months was 931. A total of 316 lost their lives in 1995, but the ILU said this year's figures were distorted by the Tanzanian ferry disaster when the Bukoba capsized and sank on Lake Victoria in May. -- Reuters Insurance News  +44 171 542 2770

GCAT	NELSON, Jan 30 - Experience and youth combined with devastating effect as Northern Districts' spin bowlers wrapped up an easy 155-run Shell Trophy cricket win over Central Districts at Nelson's Trafalgar Park on Thursday Seasoned off-spinner Grant Bradburn and exciting young left-armer Daniel Vettori completed the last rites in the morning session to end the match 10 minutes before the scheduled lunch break, NZPA reported.   Central resumed the final day already in trouble at 92 for four wickets, still 244 runs short of their victory target. Northern's bowlers offered no respite, capturing the final six wickets for just 88 runs to secure the maximum 12 points. Matthew Sinclair, resuming on 33, looked to be Central's only real prospect of salvaging the match but that proved a forlorn hope as Bradburn and Vettori raced through Central's lineup after medium pacer Alex Tait began the rout by trapping David Cooper leg before wicket for eight.   Campbell Furlong, with 17, and Greg Loveridge, 14, offered Sinclair some support, with Loveridge looking to attack Vettori by smashing two fours and a six off one over. Unruffled by the onslaught, Vettori continued to pitch the ball up and eventually won the battle when Loveridge holed out to Matthew Bell at mid-off. Bradburn finally trapped Sinclair leg before for 70 before snaring the last two wickets, with Andrew Penn caught at mid-off for six and Craig Findlay caught at mid-on for eight, to end Central's innings at 180.   Bradburn finished with the excellent figures of four wickets for 12 runs off 12.3 overs with Alex Tait taking three for 45 off 18. Vettori bowled a mammoth 37 overs in the second innings for figures of three for 81, giving him eight wickets for the match in his Shell Trophy debut. Hart's 12 overs cost just 10 runs after a hand injury sustained in Sunday's Cricket Max contest had kept him out of Northern's first innings attack.
CCAT	Krupp Hoesch Stahl AG, part of the steel division of Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp, said on Monday depressed European steel prices had put it in the red in 1996, and no improvement was in sight this year. "Intense competition on the European steel market, and ruinous prices, led Krupp Hoesch Stahl AG into the loss zone in 1996," the company said in a statement. The company said it would soon begin slashing costs, particularly for coking coal, which it may begin to import if its domestic supplier Ruhrkohle AG does not lower its prices. "Revenues were far below (our) production costs," it said. "No improvement is in sight for 1997." No concrete figures or comparisons were immediately available. Krupp Hoesch Stahl AG is the largest unit of the parent company's steel division, manufacturing "long steel" products such as I-beams. A spokesman said the division as a whole was still profitable due to healthy operations in stainless steel. Krupp Hoesch Stahl said it had devised an "optimisation plan" to return to competitiveness by cutting costs in all possible areas, including coke and personnel. The plan, which will be presented to the supervisory board on February 5, includes both investment and rationalisation measures, it said. Krupp said it had been buying coke in recent years from Ruhrkohle AG at above-market prices, and that it was prepared to begin importing coke if Ruhrkohle did not cut its prices. "The solution of the problem of uncompetitive coke costs is of existential significance for the Dortmund facility," it said. -- Terence Gallagher, Bonn newsroom, 49-228-26097150

GCAT	A senior Iranian cleric on Thursday defended an Islamic screening body's decision to allow only four of more than 200 would-be candidates to run in Iran's presidential election on May 23. Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, secretary of the Guardian Council, said the body ruled on political and legal grounds to disqualify all but four of 238 who signed up to stand in the election to replace President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Tehran radio said. "Some of them had Marxist views or political problems such as having belonged to anti-revolutionary groups or backing groups fighting the government," Jannati was quoted as saying. He said some had only elementary education or were barely literate while others had higher education but were disqualified because they were not prominent political or religious personalities as required by Iran's laws, the radio said. The council, a body of clerics and lawyers, on Wednesday named the four as Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, who is parliamentary speaker, Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri, a former intelligence minister, Mohammad Khatami, a former minister of culture and Islamic guidance, and Reza Zavarei, deputy head of judiciary. All four are Shi'ite Moslems and only Zavarei is not a clergyman. The council screened the contenders for their allegiance to Iran's Islamic system of government and "absolute obedience" to the Iranian supreme spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Those rejected included nine women who had sought a legal ruling on women's right to run for president for the first time. In the last presidential polls in 1993, four out of 128 who signed up were approved by the powerful council. Campaigning officially starts on Saturday. But supporters of Nateq-Nouri and Khatami, who appear to be front-runners, have been waging a war of words over which of them has the best Islamic qualifications. Each side has accused the other of receiving free publicity from state-run media. Nateq-Nouri, who is close to Iran's traditional bazaar merchants, is backed by key clerical groups and by the majority conservative faction in the parliament. Khatami draws support from a coalition of pro-Rafsanjani centrists and Islamist left-wingers who have moderated many of their views in recent years. Two Iranian members of parliament predicted in remarks published on Thursday that the election would go to a run-off, after a close race in which no candidate would obtain an absolute majority of votes. A survey published on Wednesday showed Nateq-Nouri in the lead with 40.8 percent of popular support among a sample of 1,182 Tehran residents, with 33.8 percent for Khatami and 8.2 percent for Reyshahri. Rafsanjani must stand down in August after two four-year terms as president but is expected to continue to wield considerable influence in state affairs as head of a powerful body that will draw up government policies and advise Khamenei.

ECAT	Taiwan's indirect trade with China rose a scant 3.8 percent to $19.883 billion in the first eleven months of 1996 compared to the same 11 months in 1995, the cabinet's Board of Foreign Trade said on Tuesday. Taiwan's exports to China grew 5.0 percent to $17.09 billion between January and November last year, accounting for 16.2 percent of Taiwan's total exports, a board statement said. In November alone, the island's exports to mainland China increased 15.4 percent to $1.853 billion, the highest monthly figure in 1996, the cabinet agency said. Imports from China actually declined 2.6 percent to $2.793 billion during the January-November period, accounting for just 3.0 percent of the island's total imports. In November alone, imports from China were $286 million, up 17.6 percent from November 1995. During the January-November period, Taiwan enjoyed a trade surplus of $14.297 billion with China, up 6.6 percent from the same period a year ago.   China, which has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since a civil war separated them in 1949, held war games in the Taiwan strait in the months before the island's historic direct presidential elecion in March 1996 to warn voters not to drop a pledge to reunify the island with China. Officials have said the war games undermined the willingness of Taiwan interests to invest in the mainland. Taiwan bans direct official contacts with China. All trade must be conducted through a third region, mostly Hong Kong. Some 30,000 Taiwan firms have poured around $20 billion into China investments so far.
GCAT	To Sant Seth, it sounded like a roaring train. To Rajendra Bhatia, it rumbled like machines in a factory. The pre-dawn earthquake that rocked central India on Thursday knocked down small houses and sent cracks rippling through larger buildings, witnesses said. The tremor killed at least 31 people, many of them in their sleep, and injured hundreds, authorities said. Seth, a businessman in Jabalpur city some 20 km (12 miles) from the tremor's epicentre, was under a mosquito net with his wife when it struck at 4.22 a.m. (2252 GMT Wednesday). "We were sleeping when it happened at between 4.20 and 4.30 in the morning. Suddenly I got up. We heard a loud rumbling noise like a train passing," Seth told Reuters. "Our bed swung like a pendulum, first right then left." Seth said the tremor lasted for 20 to 30 seconds. "My wife was afraid. And I did not go outside, but stayed and calmed her. "My building has got big cracks in the walls and the cement water tank broke. In nearby buildings there was a lot more damage and their walls collapsed. "Three minarets out of four on the two mosques in the town collapsed, two have completely collapsed. The town's clock tower is also damaged." Jabalpur, with a population of nearly one million, is the army headquarters for Madhya Pradesh and Orissa states, and a major administrative and educational centre. "When the earthquake struck, it was like the sound of machines in factories," Rajendra Bhatia, a marketing manager for a pharmaceuticals firm in Jabalpur, said. Bhatia said the earthquake shattered windows and cracked the walls of many houses. "Some homes have collapsed. People are afraid that there may be yet another earthquake and there are rumours to this effect. But business is normal and shops have opened." Bhatia said rescuers had taken large numbers of injured to two government hospitals. "Most of the people at the hospitals seem to be from villages close to Jabalpur," he said. "Police officials are inspecting damaged houses and are helping occupants to remove stuff from underneath the houses."

ECAT	British industrial output fell by 0.1 percent in March but showed a 0.5 percent year-on-year rise, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. Analysts said the worse than expected figures showed that the strength of the pound sterling was beginning to hurt exports.   Analyst Robin Marshall of Chase Investment said of the figures: "They are certainly weak and they confirm that sterling's strength is almost certainly beginning to impact on exports." He expected the Bank of England to further increase interest rates after the quarter point rise to 6.25 percent announced by new Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown on Tuesday. Paul Turnbull of Merrill Lynch said the figures showed evidence of a pick-up in consumer demand and added: "I think rates may need to go to around seven percent by the end of this year." Shares in London climbed further into record territory afetr the output figures were announced and government bonds were firm.
ECAT	Ukraine introduced its hryvna currency on Monday but distribution was slow as banks and exchange points scrambled to unseal the new banknotes and reprogramme cash registers. "We have the hryvnya, but we need to rekey the cash register first," said a trader at the main post office's exchange point, still closed at 0630 GMT, 90 minutesd after it was due to open. "It will be a little while before we can distribute it," she said, telling a small queue of people to return in three hours. The new money, which will remove five zeroes from the old karbovanets currency, will gradually replace the old by September 16. The government has ordered a month-long price freeze, from Monday, but prices of many goods were already raised immediately after the date for the hryvna's introduction was announced. The central bank has set the value of one hryvnya to 100,000 karbovanets for Ukrainians to exchange their money. The hryvna's exchange rate was set at 1.76 to the dollar at its debut on the Ukraine Interbank Currency Exchange. Ukraine's 332,270 street exchange points are required by law to stay within 10 percent of the UICE rate. Bank Ukraina, one of the Ukraine's largest banks, began exchanging the karbovanets for the hryvnya on Monday at its main branch. Ukraine's banks have held the hryvnya for at least two years but were not permitted to unseal the banknotes until Monday, accounting for some of the delays at exchange points. The Ukraine had repeatedly promised to introduce the currency since independence in 1991 but delayed the move because of economic problems. The central bank said on Sunday that stores were permitted to hand out the karbovanets in change for the first two days and asked the public not to be concerned if the hryvnya was not immediately available. Karbovanets were still being given as change at the Independence Square metro station on Monday. For Ukrainians, accustomed to bureaucracy and waiting, the greatest fear was that introduction of the new currency may be confiscatory, as was often the case during Soviet times. --Irene Marushko, Kiev Newsroom, +380 44 229 2264

MCAT	IMM currency futures finished pit trading mostly higher, and although the yen buckled it only briefly probed below key technical support. Yen fell overnight after the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan business survey showed more economic weakness than expected. The diffusion index fell to -7 from -3 and versus forecasts for a rise toward or into the plus column. Some traders waited to see whether Friday's July Japanese industrial production, expected to rise 3.5 percent, confirms ideas fostered by the Tankan survey that the Bank of Japan will keep rates steady nearterm rather than tightening credit.   The $0.009240 yen futures level corresponds to 108.50 spot and where traders said they had heard Japanese exporters were willing to sell dollars. Stiffer futures support rested at $0.009224 or 108.70. Currencies glossed over comments by German chancellor Helmut Kohl that Europe's planned common currency must occur but without political compromises. Nor did the market react when White House economist Laura Tyson said President Clinton during his second term in office would keep up trade pressure on Japan and China. She also said she did not see any buildup in U.S. inflationary pressures.   The Canadian dollar, which some pundits say is poised to rise further nearterm, eked out small gains. One commission house bought 2,000 Decembers at $0.7346-52. Another sold 1,000 September futures at $0.7322-27, a floor broker said. Thursday's U.S. data include weekly jobless claims, expected at 330,000 from 327,000, and revised second-quarter gross domestic product, seen steady at 4.2-percent growth.

MCAT	Physical prices of electricity in the southeastern U.S. finished mixed Thursday on forecasts of cool, dry weather moving into the region on Friday, market sources said. The cooler, drier system is forecast overnight to displace recent warm, humid conditions that kept air-conditioning demand firm in Florida and the lower portion of the Southeast, they said. Lower daily power prices from Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) today also pressured next-day electricity values in the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC), they said. Peak, firm electricity during heavy load hours on Friday delivery into the northern part of TVA's distribution system was quoted at $16.00-$17.00 a megawatt hour (MWh), up from an assessment of $14.00-$15.00 on Wednesday. Firm, off-peak power prices for Friday was valued at $12.00, flat from Wednesday's level. TVA was heard offering peak, non-firm electricity for Friday within its system at $17.50, down from Wednesday's $19.00.

GCAT	British police closed sections of three major highways on Thursday after bomb warnings hit central England during the morning rush hour. Police in Northamptonshire, site of the busy M1 motorway, asked motorists to avoid the entire area until further notice. "The Ministry of Defence are currently on their way to the scene. Police are on the ground. We are evacuating people from premises at the side of the motorway, including a large warehouse, a hotel and a new Eurorail terminal link that is being built," said a police spokeswoman. She said another police force had received "an authenticated call regarding a package on the M1 and passed it onto us." Police then found a suspect package on a road under the M1 and were waiting for Defence Ministry officials to inspect it. In a separate incident, sections of two motorways in the Midlands were also shut down following a bomb scare. "As a result of a telephone call this morning to a third party, a security alert has begun making checks of the motorway," said a police spokesman in the central English city of Birmingham. He would not say if the telephone caller had used a recognised code word: a standard practice of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which wants to end British rule in Northern Ireland. "We haven't found anything on our section at this stage but we've had security alerts before on the motorways and it's a finely-tuned operation," the spokesman said. He said police were treating the warning seriously and had shut down sections of the M6 and M5 around Birmingham. The bomb scare came at the tailend of the morning rush hour, bringing traffic chaos to the Midlands. Cars were diverted off the major motorways into urban areas, leading to long delays. Last week the IRA caused major disruption on one of the country's most important rail networks by detonating two bombs in the northwestern town of Wilmslow. The major eastern railway station of Doncaster was closed for eight hours the same day as police looked for bombs after an anonymous phone caller warned that explosive devices had been hidden in the station.

ECAT	The U.S. economy continues to grow moderately with low inflation and strong job creation, said Jack Guynn, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Guynn called the economy a "virtual job-creation machine" during a speech to the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County.   "Low and stable inflation has given businesses the incentive and the confidence to build new plants and invest in new equipment, and that capital spending, in turn, has helped to create more jobs and more growth," he said. While economic data have not thoroughly reflected U.S. companies' productivity gains, "the business profitability story tells something different," Guynn said. Profits have risen even as wages climbed, suggesting productivity increases, he explained.   Guynn said deregulation in such industries as banking, communications and transportation have created "massive changes" that improved the economy. Recent experience suggests the United States can experience low inflation along with low unemployment and strong growth, Guynn said. "We need to continue to question and test the conventional wisdom that seems to assume that you can have either low inflation or strong growth, but not both," he said. Guynn added that low inflation remains a precondition for achieving "other economic goals." (( -- N.A. Treasury Desk, 212-859-1660 ))
ECAT	Brazil's jumbo dollar bond launched Monday is the first in a series of benchmarks the country plans to issue in an effort to obtain cheaper debt. "This (issue) is an important step in determining what the perception of Brazilian country risk is right now," Gustavo Franco, director of international affairs at the central bank, said at an investor presentation before the launch. Brazil launched a $750 million five-year global bond via J.P. Morgan and SBC Warburg at a yield spread of 265 basis points over U.S. Treasuries. "The significant price differentials (for Brazilian debt) between new issues and Brady bonds is startling," Franco said. "New debt is better regarded than old, restructured debt, with the lower spreads a better indication of risk," he said. "It therefore makes sense to reconfigure our debt towards more conventional instruments to set benchmarks in the most important maturities as a clear indication of what Brazilian risk is," Franco said. Brazil has been largely absent from the international bond markets in recent years in sharp contrast to other Latin American borrowers like Argentina and Mexico. Throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, Brazil's economy was hit by high inflation and recession. The introduction of a radical reform programme called the Real Plan in 1994 stabilised the economy. Annual inflation has fallen from over 9,000 percent in 1993 to a forecast 10 percent in 1996. "Brazilian fundamentals are improving, leading to lower yields," said Franco. "The principle behind (future bonds) is there is no hurry." Following Brady bond exchanges for new bonds by Mexico and the Philippines, Brazil is widely regarded as being next in line to do such a deal. In September the Brazilian Senate approved a bill authorising the central bank to buy back Brady bonds. "In order for an exchange to work, you need to have benchmarks in the Eurobond market against which to price it," Franco said, adding the proceeds of today's transaction would be used to amortise domestic debt. Brazil's appeal is boosted by expecations its credit ratings could soon be increased. Franco said such an upgrade was overdue, and rating agencies were putting too much emphasis on the past. "Looking at Brazil right now, ignoring the past, the question is...what else do we have to do to get an upgrade?". "(Our debt) has been trading well inside countries that have ratings sometimes three notches over Brazil and that is nonsense," Franco said. Brazil's long-term foreign currency debt is rated B1 by Moody's and B+, with a positive outlook, by S&P. Other ratings include a B+ from IBCA, and BB- from Duff & Phelps. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7748

ECAT	New government securities issues boosted Bulgaria's domestic debt last month by more than 40 billion levs to 640.6 billion levs at the end of September from 599.8 billion levs in August, the finance ministry said. "The rise was due to the placement of new issues under the deposit guarantee law and the fall of the lev against the dollar," a finance ministry official said. The lev's slide to 231 to the dollar at the end of September from 211 a month earlier on the local interbank market boosted the lev price of dollar-denominated government bonds. Last month the ministry placed a third dollar-denominated T-bond issue with a par of $16.954 million under the Deposit Guarantee Law in addition to two previous issues of floater coupon T-bonds worth a total of $61.197 million. The paper was issued to cover payments to depositors in commercial banks that the central bank seeks to close down. The Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) has filed insolvency suits against five local banks since May and has put nine more banks under special supervision due to a danger of insolvency. Bulgarian financial institutions also hold some $958 million worth of T-bonds, issued by the government in 1994 to cover non-performing debts of state companies to commercial banks accumulated by 1991, figures show. Domestic debt also rose because the ministry increased by 2.462 billion levs the par value of an earlier seven-year lev-denominated T-bond issue placed under the Deposit Guarantee Law. The finance ministry has to pay some 7.1 billion levs principal on two coupon issues and two discount ones maturing this week on Wednesday and Thursday, BNB data shows. Figures for coupon payments were not available. "We have enough cash to meet maturity and interest payments on government securities due this week," said head of government treasuries department Plament Oresharski. The ministry covered last month's maturity payments with new security issues due to lack of revenue. "There will be no need for rollover issues this time," said Oresharski. "We shall offer rollover issues only if financial institutions wish to re-invest in treasury paper," he added. In September the ministry sold treasury paper with a total par of 31.908 billion levs while maturity payments amounted to 37.694 billion levs, figures showed. Budget deficit rose to 82 billion levs at the end of September, overshooting the annual target by 1.5 percent. For the first nine months of this year financial institutions have bought 241.193 billion levs worth of treasury issues and companies and individuals have invested 12.642 billion levs in government securities, figures showed. Budget revenue from treasury paper sales from January through September totalled 234.018 billion levs, while interest and maturity payments for the same period amounted to 215.969 billion levs, figures showed. Treasury issues with a total par of 252.589 billion levs were in circulation at the end of September. -- Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-84561

Deng, nicknamed "Little Miss Dynamite" due to her explosive style, heads a field missing three out of the top four ranked players and she is strong favourite to capture the $22,000 winner's cheque.

CCAT	Building materials group James Hardie Industries Ltd reported on Friday a first half net profit in line with expectations, but comments on the second half by the group is likely to see full year earnings forecasts trimmed. James Hardie, 27.23 owned by New Zealand's Brierley Investments Ltd, reported a 12.1 percent fall in net profit before abnormals to A$27.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 1996, in line with analysts' forecasts. But managing director Keith Barton said he expected the second half result to be significantly down on the first half.   Analysts at the company's results briefing said Barton's comments on the second half meant that estimates for pre-abnormal net profit for the 1996/97 year would be trimmed back to around A$50 million from A$53-A$54 million. They welcomed the company's statement that outlook for its U.S. businesses were very positive for the 1996/97 second half and into 1997/98. "In contrast, the outlook for Australian operations remains bleak in the short term," it said.   "In view of the immediate prospects, the company maintains its previously stated position that profit for the full year will reflect a marked deterioration on last year's results," the company said. "Growth prospects for the following year remain very positive," James Hardie said. Keith Barton said the first half downturn reflected a fall in earnings from Australian building products due to lower housing starts.   "Reduced activity in the housing sector had an adverse impact on both volumes and margins for the Australian building boards, windows and bathroom products businesses," he said. Continued strong performances from the fibre cement and gypsum businesses in the United States as well as solid performances from New Zealand had however helped the result. "U.S. fibre cement production sold out during the six months to September and we continue to ship significant volumes of product from Australian and New Zealand plants to satisfy demand," Barton said.   Hardie had just increased U.S. fibre cement production capacity by more than 40 percent to 480 million square feet through the commissioning of a third line at Plant City in Florida. However analysts said the market would not be worrying too much about 1996/97 results, which are widely expected to be down on the A$58.4 million pre-abnormal net profit reported in the year to March 31, 1996. Barton said he expected a rebound in profit in the year to March 31, 1998, following an expected fall in profit in the 1996/97 year.   "I expect it to be higher, but it is too early to say if it will be significantly higher," Barton later told reporters. Analysts forecast James Hardie to have pre-abnormal net profit earnings of about A$90 million in 1997/98. Barton also revealed that the Sydney-based group was conducting a study of the European fibre cement market, but had made no decison to enter any European countries yet. "We are going to have a look, it is a large market," Barton said. "It is early days, we are just having a look to see if we can understand the market."   Sales for the first half rose 2.7 percent to A$913.9 million, while the dividend remained unchanged at 6.5 cents per share. At 1.10 p.m. (0210 GMT), James Hardie shares were six cents lower at A$3.40 in a weaker Australian sharemarket that has been hit by a slump in the local bond market. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
MCAT	Shares rose 0.39 percent to a new all-time high index close of 3,044.33 points on Thursday, with Nokia again probing new highs but stopping short of a return to all-time high levels, brokers said. Brokers said the market had lost momentum partly after U.S. CPI figures that came in slightly above forecasts; but they said sentiment had not been spoiled. After first powering up, shares trimmed gains, with the HEX pulling back from all-time intraday high of 3,054.86 points. Nokia closed 3.50 markka higher at 337.00, after hitting 339.50, but stopping just short of its record high of 340.00. "If it goes through 340, it will soon be at 345," one broker said, adding that there had been some jitters in the market over whether Nokia could make a clean break to higher ground or face a sharp reversal. Another saw levels around 350-360 next up. Trade in Nokia A was lively at 240 million markka. UPM-Kymmene ended flat at 122.50 markka after dipping to 121.80 in fair 44 million markka trade -- its first quarter earnings were squarely in line with analysts' forecasts. Brokers said UPM had made a hefty chunk of Q1 earnings on sales of assets, but its performance was not too bad. Sampo added 19.00 markka to 470.00 in heavy trade stemming mainly from a 110,000-share deal matched in-house at Merita at 470.00 markka per share. Late in the session, Standard & Poor's European stock information service said Goldman Sachs had reiterated its market outperformer rating for Sampo and upped its 1997, '98 and '99 earnings estimates. The Goldman analyst was not available. Outokumpu added 2.50 markka to a new year-high of 102.00 in solid volume, which brokers said came from continued overseas interest in metal shares. -- Helsinki newsroom +3589 6805 0247, e-mail news@reuters.fi

ECAT	Southeast Asian nations are determined to bring Vietnam into APEC as soon as possible, possibly as early as this week, a senior Philippines official said on Wednesday. Rodolfo Severino, under-secretary at the Philipines' Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said officials of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum would discuss expanding membership at a meeting on Thursday, ahead of the 18-nation grouping's summit in Manila next week. He said the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) had agreed to argue for Vietnamese membership at that meeting and at a subsequent meeting of ministers. "With regards to Vietnam, ASEAN is committed to the early entry of Vietnam into APEC," Severino said. "We want it as soon as possible -- no date would be soon enough," he said, adding, "This week would be fine." ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Severino was echoing comments of the Philippines' former trade minister Rizalino Navarro, who said last week that Vietnam could join APEC during the Manila summit. Asked if he thought this were possible, Severino said that decision could only be made by senior officials and their ministers. Vietnam is the only member of ASEAN not currently part of APEC, which aims to create a giant free trade area stretching from Washington to Jakarta and from Sydney to Beijing by 2020. Severino said APEC officials had agreed that new members would have to meet three criteria: geographic proximity, an ability to integrate economically into APEC and a commitment to the goals of the grouping. Malaysia's Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said this month that a number of countries had applied to join APEC, now that a three-year moratorium on new members was expiring. "I would say a majority (of APEC members) are not in favour of extending the moratorium," Severino said. "The door is open." APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. The Philippines is the current APEC chair holder.

GCAT	UEFA agreed to back Germany's bid to stage the 2006 World Cup two years ago and believed England's Football Association (F.A.) knew of the decision, UEFA president Lennart Johansson said on Sunday. In an interview with British radio Johansson said: "A few years ago Germany sent in their application... At that time we said we would give preference to Germany." A furious English F.A. attacked UEFA on Saturday after it discovered the European ruling body was backing Germany, describing their conduct as astonishing , undemocratic and entirely unacceptable. But Johansson said the decision was taken in 1995 by the UEFA executive at meetings apparently attended by English representatives. "They should have known. Now it seems somebody says they did not know about it," he said. Leaders of Britain's political parties, including prime minister John Major have condemned UEFA's decision. Opposition leader Tony Blair described it as a "cosy stitch-up". "I'm very sorry about what has happened," Johansson said, adding he would be sending UEFA officials to London to try to diffuse the row. But F.A. spokesman David Davies told the BBC he was "incredulous". "When and where was such a decision taken and was it ever recorded?," he said. "Because such a decision would be very important." Davies said UEFA was wrong to choose to back a candidate so early, when other bids, including England's, were bound to come through and the deadline was not until 2000. "This is a decision for FIFA, the world governing body. The support for our bid is considerable, not just in this country. Our bid will and must go direct to FIFA," Davies said.
CCAT	InterSystems Inc said Wednesday it had ended discussions to acquire Interpak Holdings Inc from Helm Resources Inc. The company said it made the decision because certain conditions to the proposed acquisition could not be satisfied. In a separate release, Helm Resources said a large European corporation has recently approached it with a proposal for a cash acquisition of Interpak. "The company is presently in negotiations with this corporation. Should a definitive agreement be entered into with this prospective purchaser, a closing is expected in the next 60 to 90 days," Helm said.
GCAT	The fundamentalist Islamic Taleban militia that has seized control of most of Afghanistan faced a new threat on Friday after its enemies united in a military alliance. In an apparent sign of nervousness at the strongest challenges yet to their conquests, the Taleban militia warned foreign journalists on Thursday of reprisals if they made "baseless" reports of its setbacks on the battlefield. Already encountering the worst reverses in two years of fighting, the Taleban were hit by the alliance signed on Thursday between Uzbek chief Abdul Rashid Dostum, ousted government military head Ahmad Shah Masood and Karim Khalilli of the Shia Moslem Hezb-i-Wahadat. The three agreed to fight the militia, born in religious schools in refugee camps in Pakistan, together unless it stopped attacking Masood. "Whoever is not ceasing to fight against one of the signatories, the other signatories will jointly fight against them," Dostum spokesman Mohammed Yusuf told reporters. Witnesses said they had seen scores of Taleban casualties being ferried away from a Masood counter-attack near the strategic Salang Passs which forced the Taleban to break off their bid to battle into his Panjsher Valley stronghold to the east. Travellers said Masood's men had staged two ambushes south of the front line on Thursday, killing several Taleban before melting away. The Taleban have barred reporters from the area. "I would like to comment on news which has been broadcast over the last two days...and I would like to point out that you should refrain from broadcasting these kinds of news," Taleban Information Minister Amir Khan Mutaqi told a news conference. "The news that was broadcast by international media that heavy losses were inflicted on the Taleban and many of the Taleban died was completely baseless and whoever has broadcast these news has committed a moral crime," Mutaqi said, "Therefore I advise you not to release any news that has not been confirmed by the concerned authorities of the Taleban." He reminded journalists of the expulsion from the town of Herat last year of a BBC journalist after reports that upset the local Taleban leaders. There was no immediate reaction to the signing of the military counter-alliance from the Taleban, but the combined strengths of the three enemy groups could overwhelm the militia's black-turbanned warriors. Dostum has probably the best equipped fighting force in Afghanistan and his Uzbeks, descendants of the Mongols of Genghis Khan, are feared as the toughest fighters in a land of tough fighters. He also has a small air force and at his back are the nations of Central Asia who, along with Russia, have expressed fears publicly of any push by the Taleban and their harsh Islamic Sharia law across their borders. Dostum had already moved armour and men south of the Salang Tunnel, the main choke point on the highway through the mountains that divide north from south. Masood, an ethnic Tajik, managed to keep most of his armour and men together in a hasty flight to the Panjsher valley, though he may have difficulty getting them out again after triggering landslides to seal its entrance, military analysts said. Khallilli, long nervous about the Sunni Moslem Taleban, who are mostly ethnic Pushtuns, controls territory in Bamyan province to the west of Jabol-os-Saraj, held by Taleban but which now appears highly vulnerable to attack from three directions.
GCAT	A powerful earthquake measuring five to six on the Mercali scale rocked Chilean capital Santiago on Monday, causing power cuts and panic among residents but no serious damage or injuries. The quake sent alarmed residents running out of their homes throughout the city when it struck at 9:14 p.m. local time (0015 GMT).   The tremor had its epicenter around 48 miles (80 km) beneath the center of Santiago, local officials said. Initial measurements showed the quake measuring five to six on the Mercali scale throughout the city center, said Carmen Fernandez, head of services of the National Emergency Office. The Mercali scale measures the intensity of the earth's movement in a particular place, whereas the Richter scale measures the amount of energy released at the epicenter. The quake's intensity diminished in the areas surrounding the city, said Fernandez. "We have not had any reports of any injuries to people," she added. The tremor was not felt in Chile's vital copper mines, most of which lie in the arid north. Santiago was last struck by a major earthquake in March 1985 which caused deaths and serious damage to buildings in the older districts of the city.

CCAT	The Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd (IBJ), a blue blood among Japanese banks, said on Thursday that its London branch had made a 10 billion yen ($86.9 million) loss from derivatives trading as of April 1. The loss has been reported to British authorities and to Japan's Ministry of Finance, an IBJ spokesman said. IBJ's announcement follows a March admission by Japan's top bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd, that its New York unit had incurred losses of around $50 million in such instruments as U.S. interest rate swaps. IBJ said its losses showed up in the accounts after the bank adopted a new mark-to-market accounting method on April 1. Marking to market involves adjusting the valuation of a security or portfolio to reflect current market values. The old method had effectively hidden losses on the London branch's positions in derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, the spokesman said, but he added that there had been no wrongdoing and that the bank did not have any risk management problems. IBJ's losses were on the branch's entire derivatives portfolio and did not result from any one individual transaction, he said. IBJ's announcement comes in the wake of Britain's move to establish a "super regulator" for the futures markets to help polish the industry's tarnished image after derivatives debacles like the one that hit Britain's Barings merchant bank. Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown unveiled plans this week to transfer responsibility for supervising banks from the Bank of England (BOE) to a strengthened Securities and Investment Board (SIB). Barings collapsed in 1995 under the weight of derivatives trading losses of $1.3 billion. Last year, Japan's Sumitomo Corp, the world's largest copper merchant at the time, said it lost an estimated $2.6 billion over 10 years from unauthorized copper trades, mostly on the London Metal Exchange.

GCAT	The Alfred Dunhill Cup international golf team event will continue at St Andrews for the next three years, the sponsors said on Sunday. The announcement was made as the 12th edition of the event was being concluded over the Old Course. The present contract with the sponsors, a men's luxury goods company, concluded this year and there had been fears the competition could be discontinued. Bad weather at past events at the tournament's regular October date was believed to have upset the sponsors, who were seeking an earlier date. But warm weather this week and the likelihood that an earlier date could be secured after next year were believed to have swayed the sponsors to continue to back the popular tournament. "I look forward to welcoming all those involved with this wonderful championship back to the Home of Golf next October," chairman Richard Dunhill said.

MCAT	U.S. spot product prices fell sharply tracking NYMEX futures late Wednesday, players said, with Gulf Coast M3-grade conventional unleaded gasoline tumbling hardest amid weakening differentials, players said. Gulf Coast "M3" autumn-grade conventional unleaded gasoline fell about three cents a gallon, with material traded as low as 3.75 cents below November futures or about 61.70 cents a gallon -- diffs that were about 1.50 cents below Tuesday's levels. "Sellers are coming out of the woodwork but it's hard to find buyers," one Gulf Coast trader said, noting today was the deadline for scheduling front-30th-cycle deliveries of M3-grade on the Houston-to-New York Colonial Pipeline. He theorized that buyers, who had paid top dollar on previous scheduling days, "got smart this time and bought their barrels ahead of time," leaving sellers in the lurch. But Gerald Samuels, a trader with ARB Oil, predicted Gulf M3 will bounce back because of continuing strong fundamentals in the overall gasoline market. "It may be under pressure today, but I think it's fundamentally more a buy than a sell because we're seeing low imports and lower crude runs," he said. He attributed the slide in NYMEX values to profit taking after gasoline's recent week-long rally. Traders said the return of BP America's catalytic cracker at its Belle Chasse, Louisiana, refinery was also putting pressure on USG gasoline diffs. Differentials on New York Harbor gasoline grades, meanwhile, were little changed, with A4-grade reformulated offered at about 0.65 cents above November futures. Heating oil diffs were steady in New York Harbor, but about 0.20 cent weaker in the Gulf, traders said. -- Ransdell Pierson, New York Energy Desk 212 859-1632
CCAT	Asian investment banking group Peregrine Investment Holdings Ltd has agreed to acquire the emerging markets business of Carnegie, the Nordic investment bank, the company announced on Monday. Carnegie Emerging Markets currently produces research in Greece, Poland, Turkey, Israel and Portugal and is also active in Egypt, Hungary, Morocco and the Czech Republic. Its team of 26 professionals are involved in corporate finance, research and trading of equities in these regions. All personnel will become part of Peregrine Securities (UK) Ltd and will be based in London. "We see a very strong synergy between Peregrine's existing business in Asia and the Carnegie Emerging Markets business," said Andrew Jackson, the Hong Kong-based chief executive officer of Peregrine Securities International.   "Increasingly, clients do not look at the emerging market regions separately. Rather, they look at them as a single asset class. For this reason we've taken the opportunity to acquire a business which will give us exposure to emerging Europe, the Middle East and north Africa," he said. Peregrine is planning to expand the franchise and include markets like Kazakhstan and Russia. "These markets are at a stage where emerging Asia was 10 years ago. The growth potential is huge," Jamieson said, adding that in the case of emerging Europe, stock market capitalisation as a percent of GDP is just 19 percent compared with 67 percent for emerging Asia. The Peregrine Group is the largest independent investment banking group in Asia outside of Japan. Its five core businesses include equity products, direct investment, asset management, property investment and development and the origination, underwriting and trading of fixed income products. It has 33 offices in 15 Asian countries as well as in London, New York, San Francisco, Munich and Zurich. Its total assets at end-1996 were about $1.1 billion. Peregrine, listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, currently has a market capitalisation of $1.4 billion. The sale of Carnegie's emerging markets business completes the refocusing of Carnegie's activities on its fast-growing core Nordic business which employs 450. It has offices in all Nordic countries as well as in London, New York and Luxembourg, Peregrine said. --George Georgiopoulos, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4
ECAT	Pakistan will allow the import of an additional 14 industrial raw materials and products from arch-rival India, adding to the 587 items already permitted for import, Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar said on Thursday. He told a news conference the items included cotton and yarn, nickel cadmium batteries, cutting dies for shoes, carbon brushes, anti-snake bite venom serum, tyres, hides and skins, wood, whole chillies and light-weight steel rail. "These are the items that are not produced in Pakistan and we are already importing them from the West, where (the) freight element is large and our input cost rises," he said, explaining the government's trade policy for fiscal 1997/98 (July-June), unveiled on Wednesday. Dar said the permission did not amount to granting most-favoured nation (MFN) status to India -- under which the two countries would give each other the maximum tariff concessions on trade that they already grant to other nations. "There is no need for MFN status at this time," Dar said. "There are 587 items already on the list and these 14 items are not even a 2-1/2 percent addition to that list." It was not immediately known how many of the 587 permitted items Pakistan imports from India at present. Dar said the list was made due to demands from industries that said they had to import the raw materials from the West at a higher cost. "We have allowed these items after a thorough consideration, and it will be in the interest of our industry." Pakistani businessmen have said in the past they are not against dropping trade barriers with India under the World Trade Organisation rules, but they demand protection against cheaper Indian goods to save local industry from ruin. Pakistani manufacturers fear that dropping trade barriers will make them vulnerable to an influx of cheap Indian goods. Particularly at risk is the engineering industry, which says it will not be able to compete with the quality and prices of Indian goods because India was ahead in research and had lower production costs than Pakistan. Many Pakistani politicians demand that Pakistan and India first settle their dispute over the Himalayan region of Jammu and Kashmir, over which they have fought two of their three wars since their independence from Britain in 1947.

MCAT	U.S. stocks staged a stunning rally on Tuesday, recovering most of the previous session's huge losses as investors moved in to buy stocks on the cheap. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished unofficially with a gain of nearly 154 points, or 2.02 percent, at 7758. The advance nearly erased Monday's 192-point drop in the blue-chip average. That decline -- the biggest of the year -- came after comments by Japan's prime minister, which some traders interpreted to mean that his country might sell some of its significant holdings in U.S. Treasuries.   Tuesday's rally, the third largest in 1997 in terms of points, followed reassurances from the Japan government that an imminent sale of U.S. bonds was not in the works. "The comments seemed off the cuff," said Kenneth Ducey, director of trading at BT Brokerage, referring to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's remarks. "When people really took a look at them, they decided to get back in." Still, the strength of the comeback surprised many traders, especially late in the day, when the Dow, already up about 50 points, climbed 100 more points in the final 90 minutes of trading.   "The market seems to be able to weather any bad news. It shakes it off and goes back on its merry way," Ducey said. Advancing issues beat decliners nearly two to one on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume unofficially reached 546 million shares, topping 492 million shares traded Monday. To be sure, with the Dow at such lofty levels, such swings are not as big on a percentage basis as they might seem, Abby Joseph Cohen, Goldman Sachs chief market strategist, pointed out. "We're suffering from an optical illusion," she said during an investment conference held in New York.   Meanwhile, Pfizer Inc added 4-3/8 to 115-5/8, Eli Lilly and Co gained 3-15/16 to 109-15/16, Merck & Co Inc was up 4-1/2 to 103-1/8 and Warner-Lambert Co was up 3-3/8 to 118-3/4. All set 52-week highs. Airline stocks were left out of the rally. The sector slumped after another Wall Street firm, this time Dillon Read, backed off previously bullish second-quarter profit estimates and downgraded some issues. AMR Corp lost 1-5/16 to 92-1/16, Continental Airlines Inc slid 5/8 to 34-1/4, Delta Air Lines Inc fell 7/8 to 85-7/8 and UAL Corp slipped 7/8 to 72-7/8.   Oil and banking stocks also gained. Among individual issues, PacifiCare Health Systems Inc tumbled more than 20 percent after the managed health-care provider said second-quarter earnings would fall short of Wall Street expectations. The Class B shares fell 18-3/4 to 66-3/4. Virginia's Central Fidelity Banks Inc rallied after news of its proposed $2.3 billion acquisition by Wachovia Corp. Central Fidelity stock jumped 5-15/16 to 37-13/16. Wachovia shares slipped 11/16 to 61-15/16.

"The market reached a floor this morning and there were purchases by dealers," said a trader at a local bank. Argentina's FRB Brady bond due 2005 rose 3/8 to 92-3/8, while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 4 due 2002 was $0.35 higher at 115.15. The trader said the market found support when the FRB slumped to around 92 earlier in the day in London. Another trader said there were no genuine flows coming into the market as end-users wanted to have flat positions going into the May 20 meeting of the U.S. policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.

CCAT	Sweden's mining equipment firm Svedala said on Thursday it had won its biggest order ever worth 700 million crowns from National Iranian Copper Industries Co (NICICO) in Iran.   Svedala said in a statement that the order was for the Sarchesmeh mine in southeast Iran. It involved equipment to expand the concentration plant and modernise and upgrade the flotation process there. Svedala said the plant's capacity would be increased to 150,000 tonnes of copper metal from 90,000 tonnes after the expansion. NICICO is Iran's biggest state-owned mining company. Svedala International's managing director Peter Kohle said the order was the first step in large expansion planned for Sarchesmeh. "There are similar plans for modernising other mines in Iran," Kohle said in the statement. Svedala said deliveries would be made in 1998/99 and the plant will be operating at its new capacity in 1999/2000. -- Belinda Goldsmith, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1017
MCAT	Britain's FTSE 100 index of blue chip shares looked set for a shaky opening on Thursday after Labour finance minister Gordon Brown's first budget was viewed as not doing enough to dampen buoyant consumer spending, analysts said on Wednesday. With futures contracts on the FTSE 100 index declining after the 1530 GMT close of official stock market trading, dealers estimated the FTSE 100 could fall between 30 and 50 points at the start of trading on Thursday. The September future closed 35 points lower at 4,754, leaving the blue chip index looking vulnerable after its gain of 150 points in the past two sessions -- including the best one-day advance in five years on Tuesday. As economists predicted a near-term rise in British interest rates to compensate for weaker-than-expected fiscal tightening, financial stocks currently at record peaks were seen as vulnerable on the worsening interest rate outlook. A sharp fall in government bonds (gilts), together with gains in sterling, served to emphasise prospects for higher rates in the wake of the budget. "The Chancellor was trying to talk tough on consumer demand but he hasn't done anything like enough to knock it on the head," said Jeremy Batstone, head of research at NatWest Stockbrokers. "He hasn't done enough to offset further rises in UK base rates, which we think will rise half a percentage point at the next monetary meeting." The Chancellor announced 5.5 billion pounds ($9.1 billion) of fiscal tightening for the current year but analysts said after stripping out the utilities windfall tax of 2.4 billion pounds, a net tightening of 3.1 billion was much lower than expected. Paul Walton, equity strategist at Schroders agreed that "The Chancellor spent the first half hour of his speech talking about the economy overheating, yet then did no tightening." With the threat of rising interest rates hanging over the market ahead of next week's monetary policy meeting between Brown and Bank of England, investors are likely to take little comfort from the surprise reduction in corporation tax to 31 percent from 33. "But it might take away some of the pain," Batstone said. Immediate abolition of the tax credit pension funds can claim on dividends, however, came as a nasty surprise to most and could impact heavily on equity valuations. "Only pension funds will be hit by this," Batstone said. "But around 40 percent of the UK equity market is accounted for by growth funds, and 75 percent of those are pension funds. It is clearly encouraging those funds into the gilt market." Traders said the effect on the dividend yield of the FTSE 100 index will be to take it down from around 3.5 percent to 2.8 percent, making equities look expensive. Meanwhile, analysts said the 4.8 billion pounds to be raised by the windfall tax on past profits of privatised utilities met entirely with expectations, and some traders expected a relief rally as a result. "The veil of uncertainty has been lifted and companies can now plan for the long term," said Yamaichi analyst Nigel Hawkins. Electricity companies face a tax bill of 2.1 billion pounds, water companies 1.65 billion, and other utilities will make up the remaining 1.45 billion pounds. ($ = 0.602 British Pounds)
ECAT	Hungary's current account position continues to look secure while Poland should consider policy changes by 1998 to avoid a Czech-type currency crisis, JP Morgan analysts said in a report. "The region offers no obvious candidate for immediate spillover, but policy-makers now know that market tolerance for persistently large deficits is finite," JP Morgan said in a report on European emerging markets, dated June 27. A plunge of the Czech currency earlier this year focused attention on the current account balances in central Europe. With the Czech current account deficit over eight percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), the crown became a target of international speculators that eventually brought about the currency's devaluation by over 10 percent. The Czech experience may be of particular relevance to Poland, where the current account deteriorated rapidly over the past year, the analysts said. "As yet, with the deficit much smaller relative to GDP than was the Czech case, and with the economy performing well in other areas, there should be no real risk of a crisis," JP Morgan said. "However, on current trends the authorities will have to adjust policy by next year to be confident of avoiding a rerun of the Czech experience," it added. It did not recommend any specific policies. A JP Morgan analyst told Reuters on Thursday that the zloty's recent volatility and the floods of the past few weeks, inflicting heavy damages in southern Poland, have not changed the outlook. In a less detailed remarks on other emerging economies, JP Morgan said Greece would be protected from its deteriorating external position by substantial inflows from the European Union. Turkey's healthy balance of payments should keep it from any exchange rate crises while Russia continued to cherish a current account surplus despite lower oil prices. "But red ink will swiftly develop (in Russia) once the economy finally begins to grow," JP Morgan said, adding the Russian GDP was likely to start growing in 1998 rather than this year. -- Sandor Peto, Budapest newsroom (36 1) 327 4040
GCAT	Sri Lanka says it will not allow its relations with India to be clouded over fishermen of the two nations accidentally straying into each other's territorial waters. "We are not going to let this Palk Strait problem become a major problem. It is a problem that can be managed by the Indian government and the Sri Lankan government," Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar told Reuters in an interview. Kadirgamar said New Delhi and Colombo were working towards building a mechanism to allow constant bilateral dialogue on fishermen who strayed into each others' waters in the strait that separates the two neighbours. The two countries routinely arrest each other's fishermen and seize their boats for violating territorial waters. But closer government cooperation of late has seen a number of them being released from custody. Most Indian fishing boats are from the southern Tamil Nadu state, which raises security concerns in Sri Lanka. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), fighting a 13-year-old war against government troops for a separate state in Sri Lanka's north and east, maintain a presence in Tamil Nadu, which served as their rear base during the early phase of their struggle in the 1980s. "The relations between the centre in New Delhi and Colombo have improved vastly in the past two-and-a-half years. The suspicions and doubts have gone," Kadirgamar said, speaking late on Thursday. India sent troops under a 1987 peace pact to try to end the fighting between the rebels and government forces. The Indian troops were withdrawn in 1990 after an inconclusive campaign. He said a recent Sri Lankan mission to India had discussed issues affecting fishermen in each other's waters with officials in New Delhi and Madras, capital of Tamil Nadu. Both sides had agreed on the need for avoiding any violent incidents affecting fishermen, a ministry statement said earlier. Tamil Nadu politicians, specially its Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, have in the past accused the Sri Lankan navy of indiscriminately firing at Indian fishing boats in the Palk Strait. Kadirgamar said last week's mission had been able to impress upon Karunanidhi the real situation. "I think he understood that the talk of Sri Lankan navy shooting indiscriminately at fishermen is not true when you find thousands of Indian fishing boats within one mile from our shore," he said. Indian fishermen said last year that they had been forced at gunpoint to ferry refugees fleeing the ethnic war in Sri Lanka and New Delhi had warned its fishermen that their boats would be impounded if they were found to be carrying refugees. An Indian official then said the government would urge fishermen not to cross the international boundary, but admitted this would be hard to enforce because of Sri Lanka's pomfret-rich waters.
GCAT	MaliVai Washington will replace Andre Agassi on the U.S. Davis Cup team that will play Brazil in the first round starting Friday in Ribeirao Preto, the U.S. Tennis Association said Monday. U.S. captain Tom Gullikson said in a statement that Agassi, who reported for team practice last week in Key Biscayne, Florida, slightly twisted his left ankle and would not be able to compete in top form. "He and I agreed that it would be better for him and the team if he stepped aside in this first-round tie," said Gullikson. Agassi's withdrawal was the second blow to the U.S. team, which last month lost Todd Martin due to injury. Martin, also forced to miss the Australian Open because of the tendinitis in his right knee, was replaced by doubles specialist Richey Reneberg. Washington and Reneberg join Jim Courier and Alex O'Brien on the U.S. team. "We are very pleased that Mal has stepped up and answered the call for the U.S. Davis Cup team at the last minute," said Gullikson. "I have full confidence that Mal will get in the Davis Cup mode on short notice and represent us well this weekend." Washington, a 1996 Wimbledon finalist who is currently ranked 24th, holds a 2-2 career Davis Cup singles record and last represented the United States in its 3-2 quarter-final loss to the Czech Republic last April in Prague.
CCAT	Citizens Bank of Massachusetts said Monday it plans to open 22 new bank branches within the next year in Star Markets grocery stores in eastern Massachusetts as part of a strategic agreement between the two companies. The 22 new supermarket branches will bring to nearly 100 the number of Citizens Bank offices in eastern Massachusetts, it said. Citizens Bank, a unit of Citizens Financial Group Inc, will be Star Market's in-store banking partner in portions of eastern Massachusetts. Citizens said it will convert 11 existing BankBoston branches at Star Markets within the next seven months and construct an additional 11 new branches in other Star Markets within the next year. Citizens will also have the right to open banking stores in additional Star Markets as opportunities arise, the companies said. The new branches will create about 150 jobs, it said. Star Market is based in Cambridge, Mass. ((-- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610))

CCAT	Swedish fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz (H&M) on Friday said it was continuing a strong growth path in Europe, eyeing Finland and France as new markets and considering specialist stores for underwear and cosmetics. Chief executive Stefan Persson said H&M, which currently has about 450 stores across Europe, was in serious discussions over opening its first stores in Finland and France. "Finland and France are probably new markets for Hennes & Mauritz in the foreseeable future," Persson told Reuters in an interview. He would not elaborate on the possible timing for store openings or how many stores would be opened in these new markets, only saying there would be more than one. Persson said H&M was also considering setting up specialist shops, selling only underwear and cosmetics, in some of its more mature markets. It already has three such stores in Stockholm. "We are looking into opening up a chain like that," Persson said. The retailer, which sells high street fashions at competitive prices, surprised the market when it reported a 52 percent leap in pre-tax profits to 1.02 billion crowns ($155 million) for the nine months ended August 31. After generally weak market conditions that prevailed across Europe in 1995, H&M has attracted more customers this year and continued its expansion, particularly in key market Germany, where it now has more than 100 stores. H&M shares have been the most outstanding performers on the Stockholm bourse this year, rising more than 140 percent since January to a peak of 919 crowns earlier this month. The shares closed nine higher at 880 on Friday. Persson said by the end of this year the company would have opened another 55 new stores in Europe and it planned to open 50 more next year and possibly the same number again in 1998. He said markets with good growth potential were Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium and Britain. Persson said there had been a noticeable pick-up in the European market since May, particularly in Germany and Sweden. H&M sales in the third quarter of 1995/96 jumped 23 percent, pushing sales for the first nine months up 12 percent to 11.7 billion crowns. Sales were continuing well, outperforming the improved market trend in Europe, and H&M was picking up market share in all its markets, building on its current 13-14 percent slice in Sweden and one percent in Germany. "We have continued to have good sales so we are satisfied," Persson said. "I am pretty optimistic that the autumn sales will be good. We are gaining market share on all markets." Share analysts have forecast that H&M would make a pre-tax profit of 1.62 billion crowns for 1995/96, compared with 1.32 billion in 1994/95, when profits slumped by 17 percent. Persson said lower interest rates across Europe could be part of the reason for rising sales, boosting consumption. But he said H&M had taken action once it noted the weak market, improving its range of women's and men's clothing and accessories and cutting prices. However, he said the trend was not necessarily long term. "There are certain things one should be aware of, that is the higher unemployment everywhere. I am not saying this is a long-term trend. It can turn back again very quickly." Persson said H&M was not considering expanding outside Europe at the moment. "I think we have enough with our plans here in Europe," he said. "Why take the risk when it is not necessary?" ($1=6.59)
CCAT	United Parcel Service said it planned to introduce a larger aircraft on its weekday Paris/CDG-Rennes air cargo service in the "very near future." The service is currently operated by a Beechcraft 1900C, which can carry around two tonnes of freight per flight. "We are recording strong growth in export volume from western France and as a result require more lift on the CDG-Rennes route and a bigger aircraft in the 5.5 tonne-capacity 50 cubic centimes-volume range is likely to be introduced in the next few weeks," a UPS official told Reuters. The new aircraft -- possibly a Hawker Siddeley 748 -- will probably be wet-leased from Air Littoral, he added. The existing flight is one of five intra-France feeder flights operated by UPS, each using Beechcrafts also wet-leased from Air Littoral. Another flight operates between CDG, UPS' principal French hub, and Strasbourg while the remaining three flights operate between Lyon-Satolas and Nice, Bordeaux and Toulouse. The five feeders flights synchronise with UPS's Boeing 727F services between Paris/CDG and Cologne and Lyon-Satolas and Cologne. -Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax:5017

GCAT	Socialist party leader Lionel Jospin, in a victory speech after the left won a crushing parliamentary election majority, said on Sunday that French voters had demanded a reorientation of European policy. Jospin, set to become France's next prime minister, said that the Socialists would put in place a "different policy" in the interests of all French people after Sunday's National Assembly runoffs. "The overwhelming feeling that this very important election inspires for me is one of a deep demand from our people," Jospin told a crowd in Cintegabelle, southwest France, where he was elected to the National Assembly. "It's a reasoned and pressing demand for real long-term progress for the French people, especially the least favoured," he said. He added that it was "a demand for justice, a demand for a profound renewal of our public life and democracy, a demand for an economic and social policy put at the service of man, a demand for a reorientation of European construction -- which we favour -- and a demand for a scupulous attention to the problems French people meet in their daily lives."
GCAT	Formula One  Grand  Prix driver Martin Brundle has traded the luxury of a family holiday in the sunshine of Mauritius for a long weekend in the mud on the British RAC Rally this weekend. The 37-year-old veteran of more than 150 Grands Prix had made all his arrangements for the trip to the Indian Ocean when he had a phone call from a rally-mad friend informing him a seat was available in a Group A Ford Escort. "I  didn't have to think about it for long," he said. "It is something I have wanted to do for a long time and my wife Liz knew that....so, although she wanted the holiday, she agreed to me going to the rally." Brundle has been in motor racing for 25 years since he began grass track racing near his home in Norfolk at the age of 12. But with all that experience behind him, he still admitted this week, after slithering through the ice and snow of his 'recce' in Wales: "I haven't got a chance of winning." During his practice session on the demanding Welsh stages of the classic three-day event which starts from Chester on Saturday, Brundle killed a deer, was warned for speeding and crashed off the road. "It is absolutely impossible to explain what it is like," he said. "If  I had known what it was going to be like, I doubt  if I would have gone ahead and done it! The only thing I can think of to compare it to is asking an inexperienced guy to try racing round Monaco with no preparations at all. "It  is tough. If I was taking up mountain climbing, I would say it was like starting by climbing Mount Everest. But it is still something I want to do and have ever since my father did it back in the 1970's. "I must say, I know a lot of rally drivers and I have always had the greatest respect for them. Now I have even more." Brundle  knew  he was in for a culture shock after  the warm sunbathed circuits of the Formula One circus when he began his preparations on a special course in the mud at Silverstone. "I  normally  have  14 men to change my wheels,  at  a Grand Prix," he said. "But I know I could end up having to do it myself on a foggy, muddy track somewhere up a hillside. "You've  even got to do up your own seatbelts in this rally. It's a real culture shock for me." Brundle admitted he was finding the concept of  relying on co-driver Roger Freeman, an experienced navigator who is a lawyer in his normal life, difficult to accept. "When  you drive a Formula One car, you know it is your neck on the line and that you are the only guy taking the risks. But in this event I am responsible for the two of us and that takes a bit of getting used to. "Roger  has given  me a book of pace notes to help me understand it all a little better -- but I am afraid it all looks Chinese to me! "I  know it is going to be difficult to go flat out over the crest of any hill when I am told to by him because it is not like a circuit at all, where I know every corner and every bump. But I've got to do it, haven't I?" But while Brundle looks ahead, with some trepidation,  to being one of the star attractions in his car number 14 this weekend, he knows he also has to consider his future in Formula One. He remains hopeful of continuing to drive with Jordan, the team he raced for last year, but knows that until the ink on a contract is dry he cannot expect anything. "It  hit me the other day that Suzuka and the Japanese Grand Prix might have been my last race," he said. "And, to be honest, it was a bit of a shock. I had never confronted that before -- but this rally is at least helping me keep my mind off those kind of worries for the time being."
GCAT	Titleholders Panathinaikos boast a totally new team ahead of this week's start to the re-vamped European clubs' basketball championship. Four groups of six instead of two of eight mean more games, more TV and marketing contracts and more money. It will be a marathon season before the successful clubs eventually make it to the the Final Four competition, in Rome late in April 1997. Even at this stage the Greeks and the Spaniards -- Panathinaikos, Olympiakos and Barcelona -- are warm favourites. The Bosman ruling has brought plenty of new faces to Panathinaikos, including Germany's top marksman Michael Koch, Briton John Amaechi, Italian Hugo Sconochini and Spaniards Marcelo Nikola and Feran Martinez. "We spent less money this year but we have a better team," a team official said. Panathinaikos president Pavlos Yannakopoulos has paid millions assembling a team of stars in the past five years. Signings in 1996 also include mercurial American playmaker Byron Dinkins and NBA forward John Salley. Yannakopoulos is currently involved in a court battle over the $7-million contract of former NBA all-star Dominique Wilkins who led the club to its first Euro title last season. Differences have arisen since with Yannakopoulos and coach Bozidar Malkovic. "His days with Panathinaikos have ended," the club official said. The Greeks start the new season on Wednesday with a home game against Olimpia Ljubljana. Olympiakos, European finalists in 1993 and 1994, are in action on Thursday against newcomers Alba Berlin. The Greeks depend on their existing stars plus German forward Christian Welp and NBA power forward Willy Anderson. They also signed Serb coach Dusan Ivkovic who has led Yugoslavia to one world and four European titles. "We didn't need to make any big transfers this season. Most of our existing players are now of the right age to show their talent," a club official said. In Spain, Barcelona will be looking for something more than the "moral compensation" given to them by FIBA after last year's controversial final against Panathanaikos, which ended 67-66. The Greeks took the title despite apparently violating the 30-second shooting rule in the last minute and illegally blocking a shot that had already hit the board and seemed to be heading for the net with just four seconds on the clock. Barcelona's Lithuanian star Arturas Karnishovas vowed to come back and lift the title in Rome. "Now, more cool-headedly, we must be conscious that first we must play 16 or 18 games," said Karnishovas on Tuesday. Coach Aito Garcia has reinforced a Barcelona squad led by Karnishovas with signings Rafael Jofresa, Roger Esteller, Andrei Fetissov and Ramon Rivas. San Fernando make their debut in the European league after emerging as last season's surprise outfit under the guidance of Croat coach Aleksander Petrovic. Despite the success, Petrovic has made wholesale changes, including new signing Warren Kidd who joins Michael Anderson, arguably the best player in Spain last year. Estudiantes will be glad to see the return of American rebound specialist Harper Wiliams after having their pre-season disrupted by the loss of star player Alberto Herreros. Former European champions Real Madrid have to be content this year with the second-rank European Cup competition. Six months after narrowly missing the Final Four with a loss to CSKA Moscow, French champions Pau-Orthez return to the Russian capital on Thursday to play Dynamo. Pau-Orthez are wary of a team with gifted young players. Coach Jacques Monclar, who joined from Antibes at the start of the season, hopes to finish in the top three in a strong group with Sevilla, Belgrade, Istanbul and Bologna. Pau-Orthez rely once again mostly on their nationals like Antoine Rigaudeau, brothers Didier and Thierry Gadou as well as gifted Frederic Fauthoux. Limoges and Villeurbanne, the two other French clubs, look likely to struggle.
MCAT	COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures were called to open mixed Friday, with gold and silver seen firmer, but platinum group metals seen lower. Gold was continuing to benefit from the uncertainty about European Monetary Union created by the dispute between the German government and the Bundesbank. But nervousness about the possibly imminent resumption in Russian platinum group metals exports was limiting further gains in platinum and palladium, though the market remained very tight, traders said.   COMEX August gold, now the active contract, was seen opening unchanged to up 50 cents an ounce from Thursday's close at $348.60. In the bullion market, spot gold was quoted $345.60/10 an ounce, compared to the London Friday morning fix at $345.75 and the New York close Thursday around $345.50/00. COMEX gold stocks fell 5,980 ounces Thursday to 868,265 ounces, while COMEX silver stocks were up 709,063 ounces to 199,728,107 ounces.

CCAT	New Ireland Holdings said on Thursday that the group continued to make good progress in all its business areas so far this year and said annual premium new business was up 11 percent. "In life assurance, New Ireland Assurance continues to enjoy very satisfactory growth in the core annual premium business market in which it has a market share in excess of 10 percent," acting chairman John Casey told shareholders at an annual meeting. Casey said during the first quarter of 1997 annual premium new business was 11 percent ahead of the comparable period in 1996, with pensions new business sales up 15 percent.   "Overall, the directors believe that 1997 will be a year of further progress for the group." Casey said. The group said equity markets were particularly strong in the opening months of the year against a backdrop of low inflation levels. It said fee income and profit before tax for the first quarter of the year at New Ireland Financial Services, the financial services arm of the Group, were well ahead of "both budget and the comparable period in 1996". -- Dublin newsroom +353 1 676 9775

GCAT	India's new prime minister Inder Kumar Gujral is a suave foreign policy scholar with few political enemies who was handed the top job after his more powerful rivals pushed each other out of the race. The dapper former communist, who loves to recite Urdu poetry, was sworn in on Monday as the country's fourth prime minister in a year. Many believe the softspoken, two-time foreign minister was chosen to lead the new centre-left government because he is regarded as a pliable moderate with a reputation for honesty. At 77, the new leader of the world's biggest democracy has no real political base or thirst for rough-and-tumble politics. He also has no real enemies, making him a natural fallback choice for the 15 parties in the United Front coalition as well as its key ally, the Congress party. Gujral is a former Congressman. Since he was pitchforked into leadership of the United Front on Saturday, Gujral has dwelled on India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the struggle for freedom from British rule and the need for social justice and a clean government. "I am a humble man, but I have been in politics since freedom struggle days," the bespectacled Gujral told reporters after being chosen to lead the United Front. He served a first stint as foreign minister from 1989 to 1990 under prime minister V.P. Singh. Foreign minister again in the outgoing government which was toppled in a confidence vote on April 11, the white-goateed Gujral put his distinctive stamp on foreign policy, establishing in a mere 10 months what diplomats refer to as the "Gujral Doctrine". This holds that as the largest nation in South Asia, India can afford to offer concessions to its neighbours in the interests of regional harmony. In December, India ended years of dispute with Bangladesh over a prickly river water-sharing arrangement by signing a pact under Gujral's stewardship. He struck another water deal with Nepal. Also in December, India and China, which fought a brief war in 1962, signed an accord to reduce troops along their Himalayan border. This year, India and archrival Pakistan resumed peace talks after more than three years of tense silence. Bucking bitter international opposition, Gujral led India's campaign last year to reject the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to prohibit nuclear test blasts. His stand drew Washington's ire, but the mild-mannered minister did not flinch. Foreign Ministry officials say Gujral, who is hard of hearing, is well-informed, courteous and receptive to new ideas. "But for someone so educated, he can also be extremely parochial, which is where his bluntness takes you by surprise," one diplomat said. Born in 1919 in the city of Jhelum, located in modern-day Pakistan, Gujral was jailed in 1931 and 1942 for taking part in India's struggle for freedom from British rule. With the blood-stained partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan at independence in 1947, Gujral and his family migrated to India. He joined parliament as a lawmaker of the Congress party in 1964, and held important ministerial posts between 1967 and 1976 as a close ally of then-prime minister Indira Gandhi. Between 1976 and 1980, the erudite politician was India's ambassador in Moscow, New Delhi's ally during the Cold War. He later drifted away from Congress and joined the socialist Janata Dal, now the largest constituent of the United Front. Conspicuously urbane, Gujral lives in a posh, leafy south Delhi suburb and lists his hobbies as "writer and commentator" in his official resume. He is also associated with various cultural organisations. He is married to Shiela, an award-winning poet and author, and has two sons. His brother, Satish, is a prominent artist.

ECAT	German industrial orders fell by 0.8 percent in May from the previous month to end a four-month run of gains, data showed on Thursday, but analysts said the underlying uptrend was still intact. The dip in industry orders followed a jump of 3.7 percent in April. Compared to a year earlier, new orders were still up by 5.9 percent in May after a 7.0 percent increase in April. The Economics Ministry said that the fall reflected the end of a series of big industrial orders which had boosted figures between January and April. Analysts agreed that the May number, which was just shy of consensus expectations, did not signal a significant slowdown. "It's not too bad actually," said Robert Prior-Wandesforde at James Capel in London. "The fall is not a big surprise since it's been incredibly strong on an underlying basis. Comparing the latest two months with the previous two -- giving a more reliable picture than volatile monthly figures -- showed a strong gain of four percent, the ministry said. "I am not too concerned about the strength of the industrial recovery. Given the relatively weak mark there is no reason to doubt that it will continue," Prior-Wandesforde said. West German industrial orders were down by a monthly 1.1 percent in May after a 3.7 percent rise in April. In eastern Germany, orders maintained their rising trend to gain by 3.8 percent after jumping by 4.7 percent in the previous month. The industry orders data -- seen as a leading indicator -- followed the release of Wednesday of May industrial production data which also showed a slight monthly fall of 0.2 percent. However, stripping out erratic falls in mining and construction, manufacturing output in May was up by an encouraging 0.5 percent, analysts said. "Like the industrial production, the orders were a bit weaker, but we had expected a fall after the strong previous month," said economist Adolf Rosenstock at the Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt. Fuelled by the weaker mark -- which on Thursday was near 40-month lows of over 1.75 to the U.S. dollar -- exports have been leading Germany's tentative industrial recovery. But Rosenstock noted that the slow German domestic market had held up well in May, with orders falling by just 0.1 percent compared to a drop of 1.8 percent on the export side. Analysts said the data pointed to healthy overall economic growth of between 0.5 and 0.75 percent in the second quarter over the first quarter, and they expected economic expansion to pick up later in the year. However, both analysts forecast full-year economic growth below the Bonn government's view of 2.5 percent. Rosenstock forecasts 2.25 percent, Prior-Wandesforde 2.2 percent. Despite the pickup in the pace of recovery, Rosenstock said he saw no need for the Bundesbank to tighten monetary policy to head off a rise in inflation now running at around 1.5 percent. "Price pressures from abroad are being absorbed by falling unit labour costs, so there is no need to expect anything to happen on the interest rate front," he said.
GCAT	Prominent Chinese dissident Bao Ge on Friday urged the government to honour the constitution by upholding the rights of workers and peasants, and to end the official corruption he said they found unbearable. Guaranteeing the rights of peasants and workers, whom Bao described as the foundation of the communist state, should be a priority of China's parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), he said in an open letter to the NPC and its head, Qiao Shi. Bao, who was released from a labour camp on June 4 after three years of re-education through labour -- administrative detention that does not require a trial -- called on the parliament to stamp out corruption and speed up the passing of laws to protect the rights of peasants and workers. "People find official corruption unbearable," he said in the letter, a copy of which was provided to Reuters. It was concern about these issues, and the erosion of social benefits, that led to demonstrations and riots in some areas of China, he said. "I appeal to the standing committee of the NPC to hold a special conference to accelerate the passing of laws to protect workers' and peasants' rights and improve the social welfare system," Bao said in his letter, which was sent on Friday. "I also suggest the NPC impel provincial governments not to use their power to erode the interests of workers and peasants and to intensify their efforts to clean up bureaucratic corruption," he said. China's Communist Party has identified corruption as one of the greatest threats to its rule and has initiated numerous campaigns aimed at wiping it out. Bao, 33, said in his letter China faced a crisis in its ability to provide people with a proper livelihood and welfare benefits, yet unrest was met by bureaucratic apathy. Police in southwest China this month dispersed thousands of angry workers who took to the streets in protest when their employers declared bankruptcy, officials said. Several thousand people in Mianyang city in Sichuan province demonstrated on July 7 after several big local state-run enterprises, mostly in the textile sector, went bust, officials said. Worker unrest is another fear among China's leaders, still haunted by the international outrage that followed the army crackdown on student-led pro-democracy demonstrations centred on Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989. The number of urban jobless is expected to hit 5.9 million by the end of 1997, from 5.3 million at the end of March. Millions more have been sent home from idle factories and exist on a fraction of their former salaries though they are not counted among the unemployed. Bao's release from prison came on the eighth anniversary this year of the Tiananmen crackdown and he said on Friday he and his family had been under police surveillance since. Earlier this month, he applied to sue the Shanghai Number One Labour Camp for violating his human rights by illegally confining him and restricting his right to write letters, receive visitors and vote during his incarceration. He said on Friday he expected a decision on his application soon. Bao had been a member of the Shanghai-based Association for Human Rights, and has frequently been jailed for his views.
ECAT	An unexpected 0.5 percent drop in British manufacturing output in November is likely to prove a statistical aberration, reflecting the erratic nature of the data rather than heralding a downturn in production, economists said. "I think it should be seen as a blip," said John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International. "If you look at the CBI survey and the purchasing managers index, both are telling us that the trend in output is expected to be positive."   These surveys had taken into account the pressure that sterling's appreciation would put on exports, but still came out with a positive view on output trends, Shepperd said. "Manufacturers are telling us they don't think sterling has caused a reversal and I think we have to put it down to the erratic nature of monthly data on manufacturing production. We know it is a very erratic series." "One is often reluctant to agree with the Treasury, but I think the trend probably still is up, albeit modestly so." He was referring to Treasury minister Angela Knight's comment that the underlying trend in output was upwards.   James Barty of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell took a similar view and said he fully expected either that the figures would be revised or that December would show a rebound. "I think that for the fourth quarter as a whole we are going to see an underlying gain in manufacturing output of somewhere around 0.5 or 0.6 percent on the quarter," he told Reuters Financial Television. "What the underlying three-month on three-month figures are telling you is that the trend is still up for manufacturing output and I expect that to continue, at least in the short term."   Whilst manufacturing output fell 0.5 percent in November after an October rise of 0.5 percent, the three-monthly figures were more encouraging. Output rose 0.4 percent in the three months to November from the previous three months and was up 0.3 percent compared with the three months to November 1995. David Coleman, an economist at CIBC Wood Gundy, said the figures were disappointing as far as hopes of a sustained recovery in manufacturing were concerned. "Lower output was recorded in all of the major manufacturing sectors in November," he said.   "While some of this may still be attrtibuted to de-stocking, the pound's appreciation could now be starting to have an impact." Philip Shaw, chief economist at Union Plc, said the November figures might overstate any weakness in manufacturing and he expected a rebound in December. "However, it is possible that manufacturers are beginning to get worried about the appreciation in the currency and are perhaps meeting demand that exists at the moment by selling off excess inventories," he said.   Jonathan Loynes of HSBC Markets sees the figure as a warning that with the pound's strength hitting exporters, domestic consumer activity is not enough to ensure a healthy performance in industry. "With the pound showing little signs of levelling off, there must now be a real danger that a further appreciation -- particularly if prompted by a sharp rise in interest rates -- could tip manufacturing back into recession," he said. There was general agreement that the data, coupled with a softer than expected CBI December distributive trades survey overnight, made an interest rate rise next week less likely.   Shepperd said that even before today's data, he had thought it likely that Chancellor Kenneth Clarke would not raise interest rates from the present 6.0 percent at the January 15 monetary meeting, preferring to wait for the February meeting when fourth quarter GDP data will have been published. Preliminary Q4 GDP data are due on January 27. "Certainly these figures do give the Chancellor extra ammunition to resist any calls for a rate rise," Shepperd said. "I think they swing the odds against there being a rise in rates in a week's time." -- London Newsroom 44 171 542 2774
MCAT	Irish government bonds were firm in late trade on Monday on the back of good domestic and overseas buying interest, dealers said. "We have improved today particularly in the 10-year area which has performed best of all," one dealer said. "It is all down to whether or not one believes EMU will go ahead on time or not. Those who believe it will be on time are buying the market while those who believe it will be delayed are selling. Today, we are seeing more buyers than sellers. This differs from last Friday when we saw all sellers," the dealer added. Dealers said there were more sellers in the market on Friday on the back of rumours, which originated in London, that Germany was to announce a two-year delay to the start of EMU. By 1555 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was up eight pence from Friday's close at 102.48 to yield 5.86 percent while the key benchmark eight percent bond due 2006 was up 15 pence from the close at 110.40 to yield 6.48 percent. Irish bonds were trading 141 basis points over German bunds in the five-year area and 93 basis points over Germany in the 10-year area. Dealers said the market was likely to trade in thin ranges later on in the week ahead of the second half of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony to congress on Wednesday and February non-farm payrolls data from the United States on Friday. "It's a big week for data," the dealer said. --Damien Lynch, Dublin newsroom 353-1-661-3377
MCAT	UK shares ended near the day's lows on Monday as sentiment was knocked by growing fears of interest rate rises and nervousness ahead of the Labour government's first Budget on Wednesday. "This is just the start of what could be a very volatile week," commented one trader. "Nobody is interested in taking things on before the Budget...everyone is just getting out of the way," said another. The FTSE 100 index closed 35.7 points lower at 4,604.6, after being up 20 points in early trade. Losers outweighed gainers by three-to-one. The Mid-250 index finished 14.7 points off at 4,431.3.   British shares had lost an early gain by late morning after strong domestic economic data highlighted the strength in the consumer sector, sending UK gilts tumbling. Analysts said stronger-than-expected money supply figures and a leap in consumer credit in May had reinforced the need for higher personal taxes in the budget to dampen consumer spending. "The figures confirmed the strength in the consumer sector and the need for something to slow it down," said Stuart Weatherby, economist at Panmure Gordon. "This is more likely to be higher base rates given the lack of any commitment to raising direct personal taxation," he added.   Economists forecast that if the Chancellor does not aim tax increases at the private sector, the Bank of England will increase interest rates aggressively to make sure the government's inflation targets can be met. Tension ahead of the Budget, coupled with the latest unwelcome economic data, was aggravated when U.S. stocks reversed their opening gains. The Dow had opened strongly, but stumbled when U.S. data came in higher-than-expected on the eve of the U.S. FOMC policy meeting. Few economists expected the Fed to raise rates this time around but investors preferred to remain cautious.   The Dow was 37 points lower as London markets closed. "The money supply and consumer credit figures reversed the engines early on and Wall Street called the tune this afternoon," said one senior trader. "There are a lot of reasons to be wary." Activity remained relatively slim: volume totalled 670 million by 1530 GMT. Traders said most of the share price movements had been exaggerated by market-makers trying to keep their positions flat. Among individual stock movers, Severn Trent jumped 15-1/2p to 780p on plans to return 134 million stg to shareholders.   The water company said shareholders would receive one ordinary share of 62p nominal value and one B share of 38p nominal value in exchange for every existing share of 100p. National Westminster Bank was in positive territory for most of the day but closed 3-1/2p lower at 807p. Bid speculation had continued to help the stock after a report in the Financial Times said NatWest had pressed Barclays for a firm denial that it planned to make a bid. Barclays lost 32p to 11.93 stg. Retailer Next led the sector lower on worries over budget measures to cool consumer spending.   Next fell 25-1/2p to 678-1/2p and Kingfisher lost 14-1/2p to 681-1/2p. Shares in BSkyB fell 13p to 440-1/2 as a press report said there were regulatory concerns about its system of "bundling" channels and BTR bucked the trend to rise 7-1/2p to 206-1/2 after a press report sparked break-up talk. Elsewhere, Bridon leapt 30p to 136 after revealing a takeover approach from FKI. -- Elaine Hardcastle, London Newsroom +44 171 542 4027
MCAT	Slovenian shares jumped 4.03 percent on Thursday, fuelled by strong gains in drug maker Lek, as domestic buying activity heated up on the back of this week's cut in bank deposit rates. The SBI index surged 52.57 points to 1,356.25, taking its gains to 6.4 percent so far this week. "It seems like the cut in rates pushed small domestic investors to move their money from banks to the bourse," said Toni Apollonio, an analyst at "A" bank. "Gains in Lek, SKB and BTC powered the index higher. Also, keen expectation that foreign investors will return is also flooding the market with optimism," Apollonio added. But one trader added a note of caution. "We have to wait for a few days to see whether this optimism will result in a long-term rising trend. But volume, which is still relatively low, reflects a lack of confidence on the market," one trader said. Overall 12 shares rose, four fell and one was flat, while nine were untraded. Turnover rose to 102.7 million tolars from 93.9 million. (Corrects to show nine shares were untraded rather than unchanged.) Issue A of drug firm Lek was the most active share, firming 4.04 percent to 25,490 tolars on volume of 1,190 shares for total turnover of 30.9 million tolars. Preferred shares of trading firm Kovinotehna were the biggest gainers, jumping 7.87 percent to 480 tolars on volume of 130 shares. Construction company GPG led the day's decliners, tumbling 10 percent to 6,750 tolars on volume of 10 shares. Warehousing and shopping centre operator BTC rose 3.17 percent to 13,000 tolars on volume of 641 shares. Bank SKB rose 3.76 percent to 52,400 tolars on volume of 393 shares. Mineral water producer Radenska, which started trading today, closed at 1,929 tolars down from its opening price of 2,100 tolars on volume of 18,710 shares.
CCAT	Finnish engineering group Valmet Oy said in its January-August interim statement released on Tuesday it expected annual output at its car assembly plant in Uusikaupunki to rise to 30,000 cars. "Valmet Automotives' exclusive production models -- the SAAB Cabriolet, the Opel Calibra and the new Euro Samara -- will reach annual output at Uusikaupunki of approximately 30,000 vehicles, around 50 percent more than last year," Valmet said. The statement did not make clear whether this increase would happen already this year, or only later. Valmet Automotive's January-August net sales amounted to 311 million markka, up from 279 million markka and its result trend was positive, Valmet said. The automotive unit accounted for slightly more than four percent of group net sales in January-August. -- Helsinki Newsroom +358 - 0 - 680 50 242

GCAT	South Australia lost their way after openers Martin Faull and Ben Johnson posted a century partnership on the first day of their Sheffield Shield match against Tasmania on Tuesday. Although still in a strong position, a middle order collapse left the visitors on 251 for five at close of play at Hobart's Bellerive Oval. Johnson and Faull put on 165 for the first wicket after South Australia captain Jamie Siddons won the toss in fine conditions. Johnson scored 91, including eight boundaries, off 169 deliveries, while Faull contributed 62 to his side's biggest first wicket partnership of the season. Faull's departure triggered the collapse, with Johnson, Siddons, Darren Lehmann and Geoff Parker quickly following the opener back to the pavilion for the addition of just 38 runs. Tasmania fast bowler Josh Marquet posed the biggest threat and his efforts were rewarded with figures of three for 62 from 22 overs. Tasmania will move into second place in the Sheffield Shield standings with an outright victory, worth six points, over South Australia, who prop up the table. Western Australia lead the competition with 28 points, six points clear of Queensland and New South Wales. Tasmania are in fourth place on 18 points.
GCAT	Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole, unruffled by either a tumble from a campaign stage or polls showing him trailing President Bill Clinton, said on Thursday he was confident of rebounding to win the election. "The bottom line is, we're going to win the election. You've got to have confidence," Dole told a meeting of U.S. newspaper editors, where he had been asked his assessment of the state of the campaign. This comment came after Dole sought to enlist the news media in his fight against drugs and crime. Dole said the media needed to focus more on the personal implications and pervasive extent of drug abuse. "I believe that some in the news media are missing a very important story," Dole said. "It is my view that soaring teen drug abuse and resurgence of a drug culture is one of the important news stories of our times." "When you tell the story of drug use, bringing us ... into emergency rooms and schools and shooting galleries, it's not just good journalism, it's genuine community service," he said. Dole's speech continued an anti-drug theme he began to promote heavily on Monday, and sharpened on Wednesday with criticism of the entertainment industry for what he said was a glamorization of drug use. But he also told the editors group he aimed to make trade policy a theme of his campaigning next week. "Next week we'll talk about the seven-point trade policy," Dole said. Dole took a couple of questions from the group, a relatively rare event for a candidate who has shied away from press conferences. He was asked about polls showing him behind Clinton and whether his message was getting through. "Don't worry about all these polls you write about," he said. "I think our message is getting out ... we have a good solid message." "It could be down to the wire, unless we break it open here," he said. Earlier on Thursday, at a rally in Las Vegas, Dole joked about his spill on Wednesday from a stage in Chico, Calif. "Don't be afraid of standing close to the stage. I'm not going to dive off today," Dole quipped as he addressed a rally at a ballroom in the MGM Grand casino hotel. In Chico, a piece of decorative stage railing, which had not been nailed down, had given way as the candidate leaned over to shake hands. Dole bruised his eye in the incident, but was otherwise unhurt. Witnesses said Dole was saved from far more serious injury by two wire-service photographers who broke his fall and caught the candidate's head as he landed face-up on the fallen railing.

GCAT	Cuba said on Thursday it would consider a request from Colombia to extradite the husband of a prominent congresswoman and supporter of President Ernesto Samper who is wanted on fraud and corruption charges in Bogota. "We have just received the request and we will be examining it," Cuba's acting Foreign Ministry spokesman, Alejandro Gonzalez, told a news briefing in Havana. Colombia is seeking the extradition of Hernando Rodriguez, who is accused of a multimillion-dollar fraud and has been on the run since August. His wife, Martha Catalina Daniels, is one of Samper's staunchest supporters in the Colombian Congress.
ECAT	Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan on Thursday unveiled his government's second revenue-raising package aiming to earn the ailing economy an ambitious $10 billion. The plan includes selling state property, utilising unregistered precious metal stocks, applying a new withholding tax on state securities and reducing taxes charged on domestic auto sales. "We (Turkey) are needy but surrounded with wealth," said Erbakan before announcing the package. The first package, introduced on July 31, included speedy privatisation, issuing foreign-currency denominated bonds, sale of state property, incentives and tax exemptions for Turkish workers abroad to channel their savings into the country and a six-percent charge on the financing of some imports. "We have obtained a total of $1.9 billion so far in one month which shows how successful our first revenue package, which also aimed to bring in $10 billion," Erbakan said. The Islamist-led government aims to raise $10 billion from each of the two packages in the next three years. The government expects a budget deficit of 1,300 trillion lira ($14.4 billion) this year, up from a target of 800 trillion lira. Erbakan, who was flanked by Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller of the conservative True Path Party, said troubled public institutions would sell off their excess property, including hotels, to finance their huge deficits. He also announced a 10 percent witholding tax on Treasury bills, bonds and revenue-raising share certificates to be issued with 1997 maturity, a programme to register precious metal stocks held by jewellers and a hike in the monthly fees for mobile telephone users.

MCAT	Australian Primary Industries Minister John Anderson said on Thursday the outlook for woolgrowers was good, with rising prices and exports. "The markets are showing real signs of improving and may very well break the 700 cent (a kg) barrier today," Anderson told parliament.   Anderson said wool exports had increased 19 percent in the nine months to March, fuelled by a 30 percent rise in shipments to China and Hong Kong and 27 percent in exports to India. But he did not give a value. Despite the turnaround in wool markets, Anderson said there was still "a long way to go before we are back in the heady days of the late '80s, but (this is) very welcome and major relief". The Australian wool market eastern indicator rose nine cents to 696 cents a kg clean in sales in Sydney and Melbourne on Wednesday. -- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730
ECAT	China's inflation is expected to slow throughout the rest of the year although lower consumption, partly as a result of rising unemployment, could put a brake on sales, a senior government statistician said. Inflation has been falling for 30 consecutive months and that trend was seen continuing with no sharp rebound expected this year, the Xinhua news agency quoted Ren Caifang, head of research at the State Statistical Bureau, as saying. China's benchmark retail price inflation rose by 1.1 percent year-on-year in April, and 2.3 percent for the first four months compared with the year-ago period, the bureau said. Consumer price inflation rose a year-on-year 3.2 percent in April while the rate for January-April was 4.7 percent. China has set a target of 6.0 percent for retail price inflation for 1997 compared with 6.1 percent last year but officials expect the rate for the year to be as low as 3.0-4.0 percent. Ren said tight macro-economic controls had played a decisive role in keeping prices stable while the shift from a seller's to a buyer's market in China had also stabilised prices. Agricultural development had contributed to sustained stable food prices with successive bumper grain harvests holding farm produce prices steady and the absolute price declining, he said. In addition, mass production had cut production costs, contributing to a fall in retail prices, he said. He cited a buying spree for large-screen colour televisions sets and computers as a result of price cuts in the last year. However, consumer purchases were not as active as hoped for and this had restricted production while benefiting price stability. Economists attributed this phenomena partly to lay-offs at state enterprises struggling to adapt to market forces and urged the creation of more jobs. However, in recent years, housing and cars have gradually become popular consumer items in urban areas, providing an impetus for economic development, they said. But economists have warned that only a tiny percentage of China's population can now afford to buy their own homes or cars and these markets may take years to mature.

Ltd. will build a European car parts centre in the Flemish town of Lummen, Korean Motor Co., the Belgian importer of Hyundai cars, said on Thursday. Korean Motor said the project was worth billions of Belgian francs. The company's spokeswoman could not be reached for details. The centre is expected to employ 75 and to be operational from January 1, 1998. It said the location was chosen because of its central position vis a vis important markets and its logistical accessibility. Europe is Hyundai's largest market for cars. The quality of the local labour force also played a role, it said.

ECAT	Prime Minister Romano Prodi confirmed on Tuesday that the so-called 'Euro-tax' would raise 12.5 trillion lire ($8.26 billion) next year, 5.5 trillion lire of this coming from a one-off increase in income tax. He told a news conference that tax-payers would be partly reimbursed, saying Italians could choose between a tax rebate from 1999 and a type of privatisation option on Italian state companies which are due to be sold off. ($1=1514 Lire)   Prodi said some 3.5 trillion lire will be raised by bringing forward a tax on severance payments which are accumulated by companies and handed over when employees leave the firm. A further 2.5 trillion lire would be raised by demanding payment of taxes which have already fallen due. The remaining one trillion lire would come from re-negotiating Italy's foreign currency debt, Prodi said. The Euro-tax, which forms part of the government's controversial 1997 budget, is designed to help Italy qualify for European economic and monetary union when it starts in 1999. "It would be intolerable for Italy to be left out of monetary union," said Prodi after a meeting with union leaders to discuss the Euro-tax. -- Rome newsroom +396 6782501
MCAT	Dutch shares closed mixed on Thursday, retreating from early session highs on nervousness ahead of testimony to the US Senate from Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, and then rallying once his remarks were published. The AEX share index closed 2.46 points higher at 675.09, falling back from the early 678.43 high, which was inspired by Wednesday's 85-point Wall Street gain, on apprehension that Greenspan might point towards tighter US monetary policy. In the event markets rallied as Greenspan did not mention current economic conditions and said the U.S. consumer price index overstated inflation by 0.5-1.5 percentage points a year. "Our initial feeling is that Mr Greenspan's remarks are mildly bullish. He doesn't accept that inflation is really as high as the CPI figures we get every month," said a dealer. "Most people think inflation's rather high in the States -- so this doesn't add weight to the idea that the US economy is overheating at the moment," he said. Other dealers said the session's volatility had pointed towards underlying nervousness about the trend of US interest rates ahead of a Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week. "The market isn't really all that strong at the moment, it's beginning to lack direction," a dealer said. "Every one is looking to the U.S. right now and this market is looking very volatile," said one dealer. "The institutions are doing nothing and most of the movements you're seeing are on very thin turnover," a dealer said. Recent record highs followed by choppy trading on Wall Street have sounded warning bells among some investors here who are concerned a major shake-out could be on the way. "There's a lot of cash around which is why the market here seems to pop up every time there's a dip," said a trader, adding that while many in the markets anticipated a drop, stock pickers had moved in to take up perceived underperformers.

MCAT	U.S. stock index futures closed mostly higher, with most contracts marking time ahead of Friday's U.S. employment data for May, traders and analysts said. They will gauge the T-bond market's reaction to the monthly labor figures, as the overall U.S. stock market remains sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. The market has become more sensitive to U.S. rate action due to talk of asset allocation out of U.S. stocks and into U.S. bonds.   While talk of allocation has quieted down in the last several days, many analysts say the allocation of the last couple of weeks could resume. June Standard & Poor's 500s finished below their daily peak at 851.30 after finding sell-stop orders at the 846.20 to 845.80 area, traders said. Local trade was active at the 847.00 to 847.20 area. The rebound in technology stocks supported S&P futures and other stock index futures, but the tone was cautious and trade spotty ahead of Friday's U.S. May non-farm payrolls data, including average hourly earnings.   Payrolls are expected to rise 219,000, compared with 142,000 in April, while average hourly earnings are forecast to increase 0.4 percent, from down 0.1 percent. The unemployment rate is forecast to rise to 5.0 percent, from 4.9 percent. June S&Ps recouped its premium against the cash index. Late in the day, June S&Ps lost its premium against the cash index and traded below fair value, which currently stands at 1.36 points to cash. Arbitrage buy programs were at a premium of 2.70 points to cash and arbitrage sell programs 0.90 point over.   For the last several days, June has spent most of the morning adjusting its fair value after closing the previous day's session at a discount to cash. At the end of pit trade, June S&Ps were up 3.90 at 846.00, new composites were up 2.15 at 443.15, KCBT Value Lines were up 4.00 at 762.00, Nikkeis were flat at 20,550, Nasdaq 100s were up 5.25 at 933.75, Midcap 400s were 1.50 higher at 281.40 and Russell 2000s were 2.15 higher at 386.25 ((Derivatives desk 312-408-8750)) E-mail derivatives@reuters.com
GCAT	As elite police units closed in on armed separatists in the mountains of west Texas on Tuesday, a lawyer for the group's leader urged him to lay down his guns to prevent any outbreak of violence. Special weapons and tactics teams took up position at staging grounds around the remote compound of the self-styled Republic of Texas, which wants to make Texas an independent nation. They were within 2 miles (3.2 km) of the group. State, local and federal police continued to move into the Davis Mountains where Republic leader Richard McLaren, his wife and an estimated eight others have been in a tense standoff since Sunday morning. Mike Cox, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said negotiators from the Texas Rangers were talking with McLaren by phone and reported some progress. There was no clear sign that the group was preparing to surrender but Cox said officials were "fairly optimistic." He said police had a huge military advantage over the group and had persuaded many residents of the resort area to move out for their own safety. Two armoured personnel carriers from the Texas National Guard were to be deployed on Tuesday. Arrest warrants were filed late on Monday for six Republic members on charges of engaging in an organised criminal activity and aggravated kidnapping with a deadly weapon. McLaren's attorney, Terence O'Rourke, went to the area on Tuesday in a bid to persuade his client to hand himself in. "What I am telling him is that he has a lot better chance fighting in a courtroom than he does fighting in the mountains," O'Rourke told reporters camped out about 10 miles (16 km) away from the tin-walled compound where McLaren has been holed up since an initial arrest warrant on contempt of court charges was filed against him in December. O'Rourke said he was hopeful a peaceful solution could be found but stressed the situation was extremely dangerous. "Rick McLaren is not a violent person but there clearly are people there with weapons and there are hundreds of guns pointed at them so the fear is that someone is going to shoot a gun and there's going to be a lot of killing," he said. McLaren is demanding a statewide referendum on whether Texas should become an independent nation, but O'Rourke said he did not expect the government to back down on the issue. The standoff began on Sunday when Republic security chief Robert Scheidt was arrested by the sheriff for possession of illegal arms, including an AK-47 automatic weapon. In retaliation, the Republic took two neighbours hostage. Police then closed in and after 12 hours of negotiations McLaren agreed to turn over the hostages in exchange for Scheidt's freedom. Cox said Republic members were demanding the United Nations enter the fray to help Texas secede. Republic leaders claim Texas's 1845 annexation by the United States was unconstitutional and say it should declare its independence and put them in charge. Texas was an independent nation for nine years after it broke away from Mexico in 1836. The group set up its own court system and militia units and has filed thousands of liens against government agencies and private property owners. None of their activities have been recognised as legal by the state. McLaren was charged with contempt in December for failing to appear in federal court on charges related to the liens. Since then he and several followers have holed up inside the compound about 200 miles (321 km) southeast of El Paso, Texas, sending out their separatist message by fax and the Internet.

ECAT	The International Finance Corp said on Wednesday it would diversify its investment strategy in the Philippines with prospective investments ranging from emerging family-held firms to big infrastructure projects. The IFC, the World Bank's private sector financing arm, has invested more than $900 million in the Philippines and arranged $600 million in syndicated loans to 45 local projects, mostly in the manufacturing industry, over the past 40 years. "We are (now) focusing on emerging sectors, such as petrochemicals, capital markets, and health care facilities," IFC executive vice president Jannik Lindbaek told a news conference in Manila. "We are (also) targeting second- and third-tier companies, which have more difficulty attracting private financial support," Lindbaek said. With the return of top Philippine corporations to the global equities and debt markets, Lindbaek said the IFC would concentrate on helping small companies, especially those operating in rural areas, which badly need equity capital. "For example, we would also like to reach companies in regional growth areas such as (the southern island of) Mindanao," Lindbaek said. The IFC earlier announced that it had approved a $37.5 million investment in one of the country's major shipping firms, A. Magsaysay Inc, to help it upgrade its 17-vessel fleet. Aside from helping local corporations tap foreign financing, IFC is planning to help the country deepen its financial sector, by developing the leasing, bond, housing finance, life insurance and mutual fund sectors. John Pott, IFC Asian officer for capital markets, said the organisation would push for tax changes to stimulate the still tiny leasing industry. Local leasing companies provide only 2.0 percent of the funding requirements of small- and medium-scale enterprises. Other Asian leasing firms cover an average of 8.0 to 9.0 percent of the requirements of small companies, IFC officials said. Pott also said the IFC supported the concept of an equities exchange where small corporations can easily raise funds without the stringent regulations of the regular bourse. As for infrastructure projects, Lindbaek said IFC is looking at private infrastructure such as water and transport sectors. It is currently serving as an adviser to the privatisation of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, the Philippines' biggest water utility. For next year, the IFC has programmed about $250 million to be injected in four companies which are involved in petrochemicals, steel, agribusiness and telecommunications. IFC principal investment officer Kip Thompson, who is also the outgoing Philippine resident representative, said it was willing to assist large companies to be regional players. A loan package for a bottle factory in Vietnam, a joint venture between local beer giant San Miguel Corp and Haiphong Glass of Vietnam, is to be signed shortly.
GCAT	Vice President Al Gore on Friday swore in Federico Pena as energy secretary. Although he was nominated last December, Pena's swearing-in was delayed as senators used his confirmation hearings to challenge the Clinton administration's opposition to building a temporary nuclear waste dump in Nevada. He was confirmed last week after the White House assured Republicans they would discuss the issue. Calling the former transportation secretary "one of this administration's most valued and respected members," Gore said "nobody works harder or more effectively" than Pena. While Clinton was away at a summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, almost half the cabinet was at the swearing in. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala told Pena she had attended "just to make sure you're really sworn in." Born in Laredo, Texas, the 49-year-old Pena was chosen at the last minute to be energy secretary to keep a Hispanic in the cabinet after he resigned his transportation post. He is the only Hispanic Cabinet secretary but Bill Richardson of New Mexico, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is also Hispanic. The energy job held "daunting responsibilities," Pena said, including helping to keep nuclear material out of the hands of rogue states and terrorists. "We have the awesome responsibility of ensuring that our nuclear weapons are safe and reliable without underground testing," he said. Pointing to the hefty U.S. appetite for oil imports, he pledged to make the United States "more energy independent, to diversify our energy supplies, and to clean up our environment." "Wouldn't it be great to be able to go back and forth from our work to our homes in clean-burning cars and buses fuelled with natural gas," he said. He won a round of applause when he said he wanted to bring the expertise held in Energy Department labs into classrooms to spawn a new generation of scientists and engineers.
GCAT	Fashion designer Gianni Versace knew the alleged serial killer and gay prostitute suspected of his murder, according to Vanity Fair magazine. A Vanity Fair profile of Andrew Cunanan, who police are hunting in connection with the killing of Versace and the murders of four other men, reported an exchange between the two men at the San Francisco Opera. In a release from the magazine, a friend of Cunanan is quoted as saying Versace recognised Cunanan backstage. "I remember you. Lago de Como, no?", the friend quoted Versace as saying to Cunanan. The article said that "for Cunanan, who craved attention and for whom name-dropping was second nature, these were moments he lived for." The profile by Maureen Orth will appear in Vanity Fair's September issue. The magazine released details after the slaying of Versace outside his Miami mansion on Tuesday. Cunanan was already on the FBI's 10 most wanted list in connection with the killings of four other men, including his own homosexual lover, in a cross-country killing spree in April and May. Police are now searching for him as the only suspect in the Versace murder. Law enforcement officials have said they have no knowledge of any relationship between Cunanan and Versace, who was openly gay. The Vanity Fair release did not say when the exchange took place nor give more details on their relationship. Orth described Cunanan, 27, as a chronic liar with a biting wit who aspired to reach the top either through wit or charm, but "who was at the end of his rope when he went on his alleged killing spree at the end of April." He had had a number of wealthy patrons, including one who paid him $2,000 a month, gave him a car and took him to Broadway shows and on holiday in France. He was an habitue of gay video bars in various cities and targeted the people he wanted to meet. "He would investigate older wealthy gay men who didn't have families and he would place himself in those circles and that was his living," a friend told Vanity Fair. The murders of three of his alleged victims -- one had his face smashed in with a hammer -- carried the signature of what police called a "pathological sadistic sexual offender." Cunanan's father was a navy veteran, although he sometimes claimed he was an Israeli millionaire, and his mother lives on welfare in Illinois. Friends of Cunanan in San Diego said he led a lavish, gregarious lifestyle in the city's gay community, despite not having a job. His mother has described him as "a high-priced prostitute." Police also want Cunanan for the murder of his former lover, Minneapolis architect David Madson, 33, and another friend from San Diego, former Navy man Jeffrey Trail, 27. Trail's body was found rolled up in a rug in Madson's apartment, apparently beaten to death with a hammer. Madson was found shot to death in the weeds of a lake in nearby Chisago County. Cunanan is then believed to have travelled to Chicago where he may have encountered real estate mogul Lee Miglin, 72, by chance. Miglin's body was found in his garage, slashed to death and possibly run over by his own car. The fourth victim, cemetery caretaker William Reese, 45, was discovered murdered on May 9 in Pennsville, N.J. According to a profile the San Diego Union-Tribune ran in May, Cunanan graduated in 1987 from the exclusive Bishop's School, a private school in La Jolla, California. In the yearbook he was named "Most Likely to be Remembered."

GCAT	Unidentified gunmen shot dead a local government official on Wednesday in Russia's Ingushetia region, which borders rebel Chechnya, Interfax and Itar-Tass news agencies said. Khamzat Dzeitov, a deputy interior minister in Ingushetia, and his driver died in a hail of automatic weapon fire as they travelled by car, Tass quoted Ingushetia's vice-president Boris Agapov as saying. It was the latest violence to rock southern Russia following two bomb blasts in which a total of four people were killed in the last week. Russian leaders have blamed Chechen separatists for the bombs but Chechnya's leaders deny any involvement. A first deputy interior minister was also killed in an ambush in Ingushetia last week. Agapov said Dzeitov had been transporting an alleged criminal but the man escaped during the shooting. Interfax said the car was attacked in the early hours of Wednesday as it travelled on a road between the towns of Malgobek and Sagatshi in Ingushetia, which is part of the troubled north Caucasus area of southern Russia. Russian security sources were quoted by Interfax as saying police had found and disarmed two car bombs in Ingushetia's capital Nazran.
GCAT	The last batch of 84 Vietnamese refugees remaining in Thailand on Thursday left for home on a chartered flight, U.N. and government officials said. As the refugees left for Ho Chi Minh City, the Sikui Displaced Persons Camp in the lower northeastern Korat, which in the past 20 years has sheltered 160,000 Vietnamese, was pronounced closed by Thai Interior Minister Snoh Thienthong. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) representive to Thailand, Amelia Bonifacio, was present and paid tribute to Thailand for helping the refugees in the past. The UNHCR ceased all funding for Vietnam's asylum seekers in June of 1996. The UNHCR, along with a group of other Southeast Asian "first asylum" countries, agreed that all asylum seekers who had not been granted asylum elsewhere would be sent home. Refugees have violently protested their removal from the Sikhui camp in the past. Tens of thousands of people fled Vietnam after the communists won the Vietnam War in 1975.
ECAT	Zimbabwe's 1997 economic growth rate may fall below the official forecast of 4.5 percent under pressure from rising inflation and interest rates, a leading Zimbabwean stockbroker said on Tuesday. Nigel Chanakira, managing director of stockbroking firm Kingdom Securities, told an annual congress of Zimbabwe's main Commercial Farmers' Union (CFU) that the southern African state's growth prospects had already been undermined by low agricultural output due to excessive rains and depressed mineral prices. The agriculture-powered economy grew by eight percent in 1996 on the back of a 40 percent rise in farm output but Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa expects growth in gross domestic product (GDP) to slow to 4.5 percent this year but edge up to five percent in 1998. Chanakira said GDP growth could be hurt further by annual inflation -- which has climbed to 21.7 percent from below 15 percent last December -- and interest rates, which have risen to around 25 percent from 18 percent at the start of the year. Zimbabwe's financial markets expect both inflation and interest rates to continue rising this year, fed by high wage rises across the economy and heavy borrowing on the domestic market by President Robert Mugabe's government. "As a result of these developments, economic growth in 1997 could be reduced below four percent as rising interest rates slow down business activities in the private sector," Chanakira said. ---Cris Chinaka, Harare Newsroom: +263-4 72 52 27/8/9.--
MCAT	Cobalt was the feature of the minor industrial metals market over the past week against its backdrop of the civil war in Zaire, European traders said. News of a $1 billion deal between Zaire rebels and a big Western mining company on Tuesday underscored the African country's vast potential as a supplier of minerals to the global economy. However, traders and analysts doubted if the deal, or what seemed to be a likely rebel victory in the civil war, would have much short-term impact on cobalt supply or prices. On Wednesday America Mineral Fields Inc signed an agreement worth $1 billion with Zaire's rebels to buy the Kolwezi copper/cobalt tailings project and also build a 200,000 tonnes a year zinc plant at Kipushi. The deal involves deposits and mines under the control of Zaire's state-owned Gecamines. One metals analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, echoed his note of caution on the pace of events in Zaire. "It's all very well for a rebel government-in-waiting signing an agreement with an overseas mining company, but the reality is that we don't yet know who the government will be or what the government is going to look like," he said. Some traders reckoned it might be a decade before the full impact of new foreign investment in Zaire's mining industries, starved of funds under Mobutu, is felt. In the early 1980s cobalt production was around 15,000 tonnes, versus current levels around 5,000 - although this is still about one-fifth of global production. Traders said state-owned Gecamines continues to hold the key to short-term supply and any impact on prices. Opinions vary on Gecamines present state of play. Several market sources suggest that Gecamines is still producing and exporting cobalt. On Monday the chief executive officer of Belgium's Union Miniere Karel Vinck, said supplies from Zaire were still flowing. Vinck said that rail transport routes through South Africa were still running. Some trade sources say they are sceptical and that Gecamines were not selling on the spot or forward market. "Even if they are producing, no material is flowing from the region," one said. The halt of shipments of cobalt from the U.S. Stockpile until at least April 28 following the issue of a temporary restraining offer was another main focus of attention. Traders said the lack of material from the stockpile was helping to move prices higher. Other supporting factors included Japanese consumer demand and a lack of spot metal from western producers. Major producer Zambia was also believed to be running low stocks after recently hitting a low ore body. Traders noted news that Russian produce Norilsk forecast 1997 cobalt production at 1,700 tonnes, versus 1,500 tonnes in 1996. Elsewhere, antimony recent rally stalled and prices started to drift back under Chinese offers. European traders said that material was been shipped from China to Rotterdam. Recent consumer demand has slowed, they added. Around 4,000 tonnes of Russian stockpiled magnesium is been offered to the market, European traders said on Monday. "I have been asked to make a bid for the material...I believe other traders have also been approached," one trader said. He said there could be another 10,000 tonnes of metal available from the Russian stockpile. Japanese demand held indium above $300 a kilo, while they also showed buying interest in gallium. Germanium softened slightly but was finding consumer buying. Bismuth after months in the doldrums found some enquiry as stocks were worked off. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542-8075

CCAT	Shipping traffic at New York City's Red Hook Marine Terminal is expected to reach a record high of 60,000 containers annually within the next year, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said in a statement Tuesday. The increase in container shipping springs from an agreement between the city and Zim-American Israeli Shipping Co, a privately-held company, to ship 10,000 additional containers, or about 26 additional vessels annually, through the terminal. Red Hook, located in the city's Brooklyn borough, is one of two marine cargo terminals operating in New York City. "The revitalization of Brooklyn's Red Hook Marine Terminal is another signal that New York City's waterfront is growing and recapturing business and jobs that had been previously lost," Giuliani said in a statement. "Red Hook Marine Terminal, combined with the recent success of Howland Hook Marine Terminal in Staten Island, demonstrates that the maritime industry has a strong presence in New York City." Traffic through Red Hook fell to an all-time low of 18,000 containers in 1993, as shippers shifted the bulk of their buisness to terminals in neighboring New Jersey. Since then, the city has sought to attract container traffic back to Red Hook, chiefly through the transfer of two container cranes from an idle facility in south Brooklyn to Red Hook. The first shipments from Zim were expected to arrive today, but volume was not expected to reach the projected 60,000 annual total until sometime next year, city officials said. -- Wendy Pollack, New York Commodities Desk +1 212 859 1640
ECAT	A key New Jersey lawmaker has proposed rescuing Gov. Christine Whitman's faltering proposal to sell $2.8 billion of pension bonds by linking the deal to a court-ordered increase in school funding, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported Friday. Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem, proposed earmarking the first $250 million in budget savings generated by Whitman's pension bond deal for the state's 28 poorest school districts. The New Jersey Supreme Court last week ordered Whitman to spend that much to help equalize spending between rich and poor school districts in the state. The governor's plan was to sell the bonds to eliminate the state's unfunded pension liability. The move would also include legislation allowing the state to skip its annual contribution into the pension system and free up nearly $600 million of budget savings. But stiff opposition to the idea has emerged in the state Legislature, where even many of Whitman's Republican allies have said they would vote against it. The newspaper said that opposition has grown in recent days, and the Legislature's Republican leadership believes the pension bond plan is "dead." Lawmakers said a windfall from much higher-than-expected tax revenue collections could be used to balance the budget instead, and proposals to accomplish that are expected to be introduced over the next several weeks. Whitman said she has not given up on the bond idea, however, and urged lawmakers to approve the deal quickly to capitalize on low interest rates. --Steven Dickson, 212-859-1652
MCAT	U.S. spot propane prices fell in volatile midday trade on Thursday, driven by unexpected builds in yesterday's inventory report, traders said. The Energy Information Administration's late Wednesday report registered a 1.2 million build in U.S. propane stocks in the week ending October 18. U.S. Gulf stocks rose 1.3 million barrels at the expense of drops on the East Coast. The Midwest stayed steady.

GCAT	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat within two weeks, Israel Television said on Sunday. "As of now, President (Ezer) Weizman, Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai will meet within two weeks with Yasser Arafat," Israel's state-run television said. It said that Netanyahu would most likely meet Arafat before the Israeli prime minister travels to the United States on September 10. The television said Netanyahu's meeting with Arafat would indicate to the Americans his readiness to pursue peace with the Palestinians. It said the meetings had been agreed during talks between PLO official Abu Mazen and Netanyahu adviser Dore Gold. Since his May election Netanyahu has refused to meet Arafat, saying he would do so only when he deemed it necessary for Israel's security. The television said that Defence Minister Mordechai would meet Arafat to discuss security issues, including a redeployment of Israeli troops from the West Bank city of Hebron. Israel was due to redeploy in Hebron, the last major West Bank city still under Israeli control, in late March but delayed for security reasons. Some 400 Jews live among more than 100,000 Palestinians in Hebron. The Israeli president earlier in the day said he would invite the Palestinian leader to his home but set no date. Weizman said Arafat had sent him a letter "in which he spelled out his troubles and problems and said 'I hope we will meet soon'." Weizman made the announcement at a hurriedly called news conference with Netanyahu only hours after a newspaper said the outspoken president had threatened to meet Arafat over the right-wing leader's objections. "After an exchange of opinions, we agreed that the meeting would be held -- no date was set -- in my house, which is the most appropriate place," Weizman said after consulting Netanyahu at the president's Jerusalem office. Israel Television said the talks between Weizman and Arafat would take place in the central Israeli village of Caesarea after the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting. Weizman said he met Netanyahu last Tuesday and showed him Arafat's letter.

GCAT	Multik, one of two Russian monkeys who completed a two-week space mission on Tuesday, has died in an unrelated accident at a Moscow research centre, Itar-Tass news agency said on Thursday. "There was an unfortunate incident," it quoted the deputy head of the Medico-Biological Institute, Yevgeny Ilyin as saying. Ilyin gave no details but insisted that Multik's death during Wednesday night was not a result of the fortnight he spent hurtling round the Earth in the Bion-11 research capsule with his fellow male macaque monkey, Lapik. The U.S. space agency NASA put up half the cost of their $30-million mission, during which the monkeys' brains were wired up to electrodes as part of research into the effects of weightlessness on human cosmonauts. Animal rights groups in the United States protested against the experiment, the latest in a research programme begun by the Soviet Union in 1973. The next Bion flight is due next year. France, Ukraine and Lithuania also took part in Bion-11.

MCAT	IMM currency futures ended erratic trade mixed, with Swiss francs and marks rising. "It was busy off and on," said one floor broker. "But closing trade was quiet." The price boards showed estimated volume in March futures at 22,000 Swiss franc contracts, 23,000 yen, 31,000 marks, 14,000 sterling and 8,500 Canadian dollar. "I actually think currencies would have been a lot higher if there wasn't so much spreading going on," said the broker. March yen stayed above $0.008393, about 120.00 spot, a level that some said seemed defended partly by options ploys.
GCAT	Most of Ethiopia's national soccer squad have disappeared in Rome while on their way to Morocco for an African National Cup match, state radio reported on Tuesday. The radio said the team leader had requested permission to return home with the remaining players, because he believed the match against the Moroccans was impossible under the circumstances. The radio did not specify how many of the 23-man squad went missing during the 16-hour Rome stopover The Horn of Africa nation was briefly an Italian colony.
MCAT	French stocks closed sharply higher on Wednesday in a rally triggered by three days of gains on Wall Street. The blue-chip CAC-40 index finished up 38.55 points, or 1.49 percent, at 2,617.55. The index finished off its session highs after Wall Street snapped its rising streak in early trading, but brokers said the bourse was sustained by expectations that the franc's strength left scope for a French interest rate cut. The CAC-40 April futures contract rose 38 points to 2,820. Volume was 6.77 billion francs.   * Cosmetics group L'Oreal rose 4.23 percent to 1,995 francs after brokerage Cheuvreux de Virieu raised its rating to buy and included L'Oreal's 57-percent owned Synthelabo pharmaceuticals subsidiary in its list of recommended shares. Synthelabo rose 2.12 percent to 626 francs. * Renault shares rose 3.24 percent to 146.50 francs. Traders said that although Renault and Volvo denied a report that Renault would sell Volvo its Mack Trucks unit, the talk spurred speculation that Renault may be preparing a restructuring of its ailing truck operations. It recently announced job cuts and a plant closure in its car operations.   * Cie Generale des Eaux unit SGE extended Tuesday's four percent gain, adding 5.81 percent to 133 francs. Brokerage Dupont Denant raised its rating on the stock and earnings estimates on Tuesday after an analysts' meeting. * CCMX rose 13.76 percent to 62 francs on the first day of a 62 franc per share buyout by Clio, held by the state entity Consortium de Realisation which groups Credit Lyonnais assets to be sold. * Canal Plus closed up 3.73 percent to 1,085 francs, buoyed by the increase in its weighting in the CAC index to 1.5 percent from 0.2 percent.

ECAT	Italy's Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Tuesday he believed that inflation in January would fall to around 2.5 percent and stay at that level for the coming months. Prodi told reporters that Italy was "on the right track" regarding inflation. "It will be around 2.5 percent and the forcasts for the coming months put it at around the same level." Inflation in December stood at 2.6 percent year-on-year and preliminary data from 11 sample cities had showed January inflation unchanged. --Rome newsroom +396-6782501
GCAT	Former Russian security chief Alexander Lebed on Thursday called on his supporters to stay calm in the wake of his dramatic sacking by President Boris Yeltsin. "I call on my comrades in arms, my allies and people who I probably do not know in person...do not do anything abrupt. We act only using constitutional means," he told a news conference in Moscow.   Lebed was speaking less than three hours after Yeltsin appeared on national television and signed a decree sacking him for what the Russian leader said was his lack of team spirit and open ambition to become the country's next leader. Lebed was more ambiguous when asked what he would do if his supporters started protesting about his dismissal. "I want to see first whether this will happen. I will make my decisions judging by the circumstances," he replied. Around 11 million people voted for Lebed in the first round of June's presidential elections, in which he finished third. A recent opinion poll said he was Russia's most trusted politician.
GCAT	Israel's Arabs live a paradox, carrying passports of a state proclaiming equality for all yet created as a homeland for the Jewish people. "Something is still rotten in the State of Israel," Arab Israeli Professor Said Zaydani told his largely Jewish audience, apologising for his corruption of Shakespeare's Hamlet. "To be an Arab in this state means to be discriminated and separated," Zaydani, a political philosopher, told a recent Tel Aviv University symposium on Arab politics in Israel. "This rottenness must be uprooted." Israel's 850,000 Arabs, some 18 percent of the population, have long complained the Jewish majority treats them as a fifth column, depriving them of jobs and benefits contingent on service in the Jewish state's army from which they are exempt. They also object to what they complain is inadequate government funding of their schools, villages and towns. One statistic captures their plight: Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics says 31.2 percent of "non-Jewish" families were under the poverty line in 1995, nearly double the 16.8 percent of all Israeli families classified as poor. For many Israeli Arabs -- or Palestinian Israelis, as they prefer to be known -- the struggle for equality is a fight for budgets on par with those of Jewish cities and institutions. But Zaydani argues Arabs will never enjoy equal opportunity and decision-making power in a country which, while a democracy proclaiming rights for all, defines itself as a Jewish national state. "I am in a grey area between subject and citizen," he said. For Zaydani and a new generation of Arab thinkers, the fight for equality exceeds demands to merely shrink economic gaps between Arabs and Jews. Israel, he told his uneasy audience, must be transformed from the "Jewish state" into a "state of all its citizens." "An Israeli identity for all," he declared. "If this is fulfilled I will have no problem being an Israeli as a member of a liberal, secular, democratic country." 'ISRAELISATION'...WITH ARAB AUTONOMY But Haifa University Professor Sammy Smooha, an Arab Israeli who has tracked his community's political views in 20 years of surveys, said there was only narrow support for Zaydani's ideas. "Over the years, the Arabs in Israel are becoming less and less rejecting of the Jewish national state," Smooha told Reuters. He said the percentage of Israeli Arabs who opposed Israel as a "Jewish, Zionist state" dropped from 57 percent in 1980 to 35 percent in 1995. Those Arabs who called themselves "anti-Zionist" nearly halved from 47 percent in 1988 to 25 percent in 1995. "Israelisation", Smooha said, was strong among Israel's Arabs. Zaydani partly concurred: "Most Arabs in Israel have decided they want to remain part and parcel of the state of Israel. But such a decision is conditional: I want to be wholeheartedly Israeli." Jewish academics argued the call for a "new Israeli identity" would strip Jews of their right to shape their national destiny. "The state of Israel was set up to give the Jewish people national self-determination," Hebrew University Professor Ruth Gavison told the conference. "It is legitimate that those who came here for a Jewish state do not want a 'state of all its citizens'." Gavison conceded that Israel, despite its pluralistic tendencies, gave only "lip service" to equality of citizenship. But she insisted Israel could be both Jewish and an inclusive liberal democracy: "It all depends on how we see democracy and how we see Judaism or Jewishness." Alouph Hareven, co-director of the Sikkuy Association for the Advancement of Equal Opportunity, said: "A country that doesn't respect the rights of all its citizens is not a Jewish state." Jewish academics argued that the Arab clamour for equal citizenship for each Israeli was misleading. "I don't see the Arabs as wishing to have a state for all its citizens but for all its nations...they want rights not only as individuals but as a collective." Gavison said. Zaydani himself paired his call for uniform citizenship with a demand for jurisdictional autonomy for Israel's Arabs. Autonomy, he explained, would meet their "impulse for national fulfilment". Smooha said 81 percent of Israel's Arabs desired "some form" of autonomy, in effect turning Israel into a binational state. A MIDDLE EASTERN QUEBEC? Hebrew University Professor Yehoshua Porath, citing French Canadian demands to split the province of Quebec from liberal Canada, said Israeli Arab autonomy would lead to separatism. "The French people of Quebec don't want Canada. I fear the Arabs in a binational state will not want Israel," he said. Porath told the conference the threat of separatism was magnified as Israel bartered with the Palestine Liberation Organisation over the West Bank and Gaza. "The level of identification of Israeli Arabs with the PLO is growing," he said. The PLO hopes to expand limited self-rule in areas Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war into an independent state. But Smooha dismissed the threat of separatism. "Palestinian identity is considered by Jews as disloyal and Arabs want to encourage integration into Israel," he told Reuters. "It is clear both Arabs and Jews agree on one option only -- that Israel will remain a Jewish, Zionist state and Arabs will receive democratic rights, a due share of resources and control of religious and educational institutions." "Arabs know they are stuck with this state."
MCAT	The Japanese stock market, which has fallen sharply on pessimism about the economy, may recover soon, a visiting senior official of Dresdner Bank AG said here on Monday. "There is too much optimism in the U.S. stock market while there too much pessimism here," Gerhard Eberstadt, member of the board of managing directors, told reporters. He said that Japanese investors were too downbeat on their own market. "But we are not pessimistic about Japan," he said without elaborating. He also said Japanese interest rates are likely to stay at the current record low levels for the near future.
ECAT	Slovakia can further sustain its impressive economic growth of the past three years, but the government must correct macroeconomic imbalances that emerged in 1996, the World Bank said. In a report obtained by Reuters on Wednesday, the bank praised Slovakia for one of the best macroeconomic performances in central Europe, but laid down several targets which it considers crucial to maintain the favourable trend. Slovakia's GDP is forecast to grow by some 6.8 to 7.0 percent in 1996, after a full 1995 increase of 7.4 percent. The government expects GDP to grow at least by 6.4 percent in 1997. "In the macroeconomic area, the main issue to be addressed is the recent deterioration of the external accounts," the report said. It pointed to the growing current account deficit which rose to around eight percent of GDP over 1996, from a two percent surplus in 1995. The bank said a relatively low level of indebtedness (35 and 20 percent of GDP in gross and net external debts in the past two years respectively) and good credit rating allow the country to finance the current accoutn deficit without major difficulties. But it warned that the present volume of the current account deficit was not sustainable in the long-term horizon as it could result in excessive increase in indebtedness and possible future finacing problems. The bank proposed a medium to long-term macroeconomic framework for sustained growth, in which it calls for fixed investment to remain at some 30 percent of GDP. Currently it is about 34 percent of GDP. The current account deficit should be reduced to around three percent of the GDP, with financing of at least half of the shortfall through foreign direct investment, the bank said. If these targets are met, Slovakia should be able to sustain growth rates of around six percent, it concluded. -- Peter Laca, Bratislava Newsroom, 42-7-563-3687
GCAT	The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights on Tuesday strongly condemned the ambush killing of four staff of the U.N. human rights field operation in Rwanda. In a statement, Jose Ayala-Lasso said he had ordered human rights officers in Cyangugu, Gisenji and Kibuye to evacuate to Kigali and had asked the Rwandan military to investigate the attack and punish those responsible.   "I strongly condemn this attack and offer my deepest sympathy to the families of those killed," Ayala-Lasso said in the statement, which did not identify the victims. "The two international and two local staff were killed in an ambush while driving in two clearly marked United Nations vehicles," he added. "This is the first loss of life resulting from an attack in the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda." His office has 139 human rights officers working through Rwanda to protect and promote human rights. In Kigali, spokeswoman Marie Vander Elst told Reuters that four U.N. emmployees, including a Briton and a Cambodian, were killed in an ambush while carrying out normal duties in the commune of Karengera in Cyangugu preferecture, approximately 350 km (200 miles) southwest of Kigali on the Zairean border. A driver in the team was hurt and was undergoing surgery.

Barge premiums were put steady around March IPE +$24 fob with cargoes at March IPE +$25-26 cif NWE. A possible arb to the East was giving some support but the logistical problems of loading a large enough cargo from one port to make it worthwhile was hindering physical deals, traders said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8980
MCAT	June 11 - U.S. stock index futures stuck at mostly firmer levels in midafternoon trade. Brokers said volume occurred in spurts, with some noting signs of portfolio adjustment, sector rotation.

MCAT	Chilean blue chips are expected to see-saw as the market seeks to find its footing after losing ground steadily for the last week, said dealers. "It could end positive as there was heavy profit takiing yesterday," said Jaime Pena y Lillo, portfolio manager at brokerage Socimer. Investors will be keeping a close eye on Wall Street which suffered its second largest daily loss Monday, he said. Turnover is seen continuing light as foreign investors continue to stay on the sidelines, they said.   The 40-share  .IPSA index closed Monday down 1.06 percent at 131.5 points.

MCAT	Sterling gave in to profit-takers in European trading on Monday, slumping almost two percent against the mark and probing six-weeks lows against the broadly strong dollar. The dollar rose to levels not seen since November 1989 -within a whisker of 1.85 marks - as it continued its onslaught on the flagging German currency. The pound got battered amid a growing perception that a UK interest rate rise might not come as soon as next week when the Bank of England's monetary policy committee meets, dealers said.   "Sterling's rally is the product of an environment in which interest rates and being outside EMU are all that matter, and this environment is beginning to shift," said Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan in Europe. "We are beginning to shift into an environment where investors are not only looking at yield." The principal fuel for investors' risk appetite - low interest rates in Germany, Japan and the U.S. - remained in place. "But there is some nervousness over the outlook for German and Japanese rates given the unwelcome pace of the decline in the mark and the strong economic recovery in Japan."
ECAT	The Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) said it raised its main interest rate to an all-time high of 300 percent from 108 percent to counter high inflation expectations amid an economic crisis. "The BNB raised the central interest rate to an annual 300 percent, in force from September 24, in an effort to restore confidence in the lev currency through providing a realistic interest rate on deposits," the BNB said in a statement. The current interest rates on deposits in commercial banks range between 90 and 95 percent annually, while cumulative inflation for the first eight months was 113 percent.   Collapsing confidence in local banks triggered a mass withdrawal of lev deposits and their conversion into foreign currency, which decapitalised many banks and made the lev slump to 237 per dollar today from around 71 at the start of 1996. In another bid to normalise settlement and restore confidence among commercial banks, the BNB today again allowed them to use up to a half of their minimum required reserves for emergency refinancing each month. Currently banks could use up to 10 percent of their reserves in the central bank for such refinancing. The BNB also said it would continue supporting the lev on the domestic forex market and hoped that proceeds from the government's privatisation programme would boost its reserves. Banks with excessive lev supplies will be able to open foreign currency deposits, or settlement accounts at the BNB at preferential interest rates, the BNB said. -- Sofia Newsroom, (++359-2) 981 8569
MCAT	June T-bond futures will have a tough time getting through resistance at 107-28/31, and a failure to do so could see the market back down to 107-00, technical analysts said on Wednesday. "While T-bonds are holding under the April 9 high at 107-28 they could head to the 107-08 to 106-31 area," said Robin Wilkin senior technical analyst at MCM YieldWatch in London. "The retracements there will support the contract. He said a break was required to confirm a stronger correction. June T-bond futures were at 107-20, unchanged from the Chicago finish, in automated trade at 1013 GMT. Gerry Celaya, senior technical analyst at American Express Bank in London, noted major resistance at 107-28/31. He said Tuesday's sharp move through trendline resistance at 107-12 set up a move to 110-00. But a failure to break the key resistance would worry bond bulls, he added. He also cited major resistance at the March 25 high of 109-25, as well as congestion around the 109-00 area. Wilkin said a successful move higher would target 109-06, which was a 38.2 percent retracement of the fall from 113-25 on February 18 to a low of 106-12 on April 11. At the short end, September Eurodollar futures were unchanged at 93.71 in automated trade. Analysts said there was minor resistance at 93.72 before the contract faced congestion at 93.75.
MCAT	Following sharp advances this week, CBOT rice futures ended mixed Friday, with nearby falling in corrective action, traders said. "You had a big week this week," said one pit trader. "This is just a setback." January and March made contract highs for the third straight session. Despite Friday's lower close, most rice traders said the market's technical and fundamental factors are still bullish, so prices should continue to march higher in the near term. "We've seen rising prices, rising volume, and rising open interest," said one trader. "That's a bullish market." Hedge selling in new-crop contracts was noted again today. All week long, farmer selling has limited gains in the market, traders said. Concerns about the possibility of El Nion reducing rice production in Asia continued to support prices, floor traders said. Volume was estimated at 1,100 contracts, which is a good bit lower than Thursday's actual volume of 2,009 contracts. Rice closed eight cents lower to four cents higher, with July down eight at $11.67 per cwt. ((Anna Driver 312-408-8720))
GCAT	Australian Michael Doohan joined motorcycling's greats on Sunday when victory in the British Grand Prix clinched his fourth successive 500cc world championship title. The 32-year-old becomes only the third man to win four straight titles after Briton Mike Hailwood (1962-65) and Italian great Giacomo Agostini, who won seven in a row from 1966. "When I started racing I could never have dreamt that I would win four championships," said Doohan. Doohan had won nine of the 10 previous races this season and such was his lead that he needed only a top seven finish to clinch the title with four races to spare. But he was in no mood to take things easy. "I really wanted to win and was not just riding for points," he said. Although starting from pole, Doohan made a slow getaway and went into the first corner in fifth place. However, by the third lap he was in the lead and looked set to cruise to victory. But his Japanese Honda team mate Tadayuki Okada shadowed him doggedly and slipped past on lap 21. There followed a thrilling duel, with Doohan eventually retaking the lead on lap 25 which he held until the end of the 30-lap race. "Today's race was tough and Tadi (Okada) put up a good fight. It was a very close battle," Doohan said. He thanked his Honda team, saying: "The bike has been fantastic all year. The guys have got it spot on every time." The victory, his third in a row at Donington, leaves him with four races left to try to beat Agostini's record 11 wins in a season. He has 270 points, Okada has 149 and Nobuatsu Aoki of Japan has 139. Doohan confirmed he planned to race again in 1998 -- his 10th season in the 500cc class. "I am still feeling the same as when I was 23. I still enjoy racing," he said. But, despite his thanks to Honda, who filled the top four places on Sunday, he is not certain to stay with the team next season. "We will have to see what the best package is," he said. Brazil's Alex Barros took third place in the race on his Honda, having won another close fight with Italian Luca Cadalora on a Yamaha who eventually came in fifth behind Aoki. The 250cc race saw a superb battle between Germany's Ralf Waldmann and Tetsuya Harada of Japan. The lead changed hands several times until Waldman forced his way through on the inside on the last corner to pip Harada for the chequered flag. Harada stretched his lead in the championship while Waldmann moved into second place ahead of Italian reigning champion Max Biaggi who fell during the race. Harada has 182 points to the 176 of Waldmann and 160 of Biaggi. The 125cc class completed a fine day's racing with another fantastically close tussle between championship leader Valentino Rossi of Italy and Japanese duo Tomomi Manako and Masaki Tokudome. Rossi was leading into the last corner when Manako slipped past on the inside, only to overbalance and crash. He scrambled up and bundled his machine over the line to take eighth. Rossi won, with Tokudome second and Noboru Ueda of Japan third. Rossi leads the championship with 245 points, Ueda is second on 159 with Manako third on 132.

CCAT	Cirrus Logic Inc said on Wednesday it had signed a letter of intent to license U.S. Robotics Corp's new x2 modem technology that enables 56 kilobytes-per-second data transfer over common phone lines. Cirrus expects to offer x2-compliant modem chipsets, based on its FastPath Telephony Platform, to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that are deploying higher data rate service. Financial terms of the licensing deal were undisclosed. U.S. Robotics says x2 can increase the download speed from 33.6Kbps up to 56Kbps, equivalent to many Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) connections. But using x2 does not require new phone equipment like other high-speed products do. Cirrus Logic said it believes its FastPath modem chipset has both the performance and flexibility to rapidly bring x2 technology to market.
GCAT	Two motorists were arrested on Wednesday after one threw a cup of coffee at the other's vehicle and the second one shot back in what police called a case of road rage. Police said Brian Henry, 33, was in a dump truck, tailing close behind Donald Khoury, 59. Henry beeped his horn and flashed his lights, and when he was finally able to pass, he threw a cup of coffee at Khoury's Subaru station wagon, police said. Khoury then fired a shot from a .25 calibre gun at Henry's truck but missed, police said. No one was injured in the incident on Interstate highway 91 in the Hartford suburb of Windsor Locks, but it created a huge traffic jam during the morning rush hour. State Police Sgt. Dale Hourigan called it a case of road rage. "It's just a situation where we have a person who is trying to get through traffic, was frustrated, and he got angry and threw a cup of coffee, and the other person had a gun," Hourigan said. Khoury, of Granby, Massachusetts, was charged with carrying dangerous weapons, reckless endangerment, having weapons in a motor vehicle, unlawful discharge of firearms, and shooting weapons on a public highway. He was released on $1,000 bond and must appear in court on July 22. Henry, of Springfield, Massachusetts, was charged with throwing objects at a motor vehicle and following too close. He was released after promising to appear in court on July 21.

CompUSA operates 127 Computer Superstores in 57 major metropolitan markets across the United States.
ECAT	Argentina's Finance Secretary Pablo Guidotti said Monday the country is going to issue a 10-year bond denominated in sterling, equivalent to $300 million. "The announcement will be in England and the launch will take place in the next two weeks," Guidotti told reporters.   London market players started speculating last week that Argentina was planning a sterling issue. Guidotti added that the second auction of the government's five-year Bonte Treasury bond is likely to take the form of an extension of the first tranch by $750 million. The auction is set to take place in June. The first tranch, of $750 million, was issued in May. That would leave only $500 million to be issued through the rest of the year, of the Bonte which the government has said will total $2.0 billion.

CCAT	TransColorado Gas Transmission Co said it plans to move ahead with the second phase of the TransColorado Pipeline Project. Construction will begin early in 1998, the pipeline said. It is equally owned by KN Energy Inc, El Paso Energy Corp and Questar Corp The TransColorado Pipeline has been approved in its entirety by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It said pre-construction work began last week on the project, including engineering and design, environmental updates, and right-of-way and permit procurement. The remainder of the TransColorado Pipeline is expected to be completed in time for the 1998-99 heating season. Phase I of the TransColorado Pipeline Project was completed in December 1996 and has been providing access to New Mexico's Blanco Hub for northern San Juan Basin producers. The pipeline said several contracts have been signed with suppliers since it began operation as a result of growth in demand for Rocky Mountain natural gas and the anticipated reduced transmission constraints that will result from the fully completed project. "We are moving ahead with the TransColorado Pipeline Project because it will provide more opportunities for producers of natural gas on the Western Slope," the pipeline said in a statement. Phase II of the TransColorado Pipeline will extend 265 miles north into Rio Blanco County, Colo., with its terminus about 25 miles east of Rangely, Colo.  It will have a capacity of 300 million cubic feet per day and will use 24-inch pipe. Phase I included the construction of 22.5 miles of 24-inch diameter pipe, and 2.5 miles of 16-inch diameter pipe, extending from the Coyote Gulch plant in La Plata County to the Blanco Hub. The Coyote Gulch Gas Treating Plant is a separate project that treats natural gas before it enters the pipeline.  It began operation in December 1996 and has a capacity of 120 million cubic feet per day. ((-- New York Newsdesk 212 859-1610))
MCAT	Japan's tumbling stock market was viewed phlegmatically by European markets on Thursday, with the plummeting Nikkei index providing little more than a macabre spectator sport for traders and analysts here. For any investor in Japan the market's slide has been painful, but the immediate knock-on effect on European bourses of the Nikkei's 11.5 percent slide since mid-December has so far been slim, investment strategists said. Japan may be the world's second-biggest economy but European companies have scant exposure there. Fears of slowing growth after the government's austere 1997 budget -- which prompted the Nikkei's selloff -- have little bearing on corporate Europe. For the time being, European markets show no sign of being diverted from their usual focus on the trend in interest rates in Europe and the United States and the state of economies on either side of the Atlantic. "As an export market it is non-existant and we are still more concerned about the U.S. bond market," said Ian Williams, strategist at Panmure Gordon. "There are more important things that are influencing the markets here." Bijal Shah, global strategist at Merrill Lynch, said there were sound reasons for the European markets' indifference. "You have to look at what drives an equity market, which is domestic interest rates and the outlook for earnings growth," said Shah. "Also from a sentiment point of view fund managers tend to attatch greater importance to Wall Street than Tokyo." Granted, one risk is that Japanese banks will be forced to sell overseas bond and equity holdings to prop up capital ratios depleted by the plummeting value of their equity holdings. "There was a degree of panic in Japan overnight especially over the possible impact on the financial sector," said Bill O'Neill, global strategist at HSBC James Capel. But O'Neill said the risk to banks was less severe than it was when markets dropped in 1992, as banks have since then issued equity to prop up their capital ratios and had also written off at least some of their stock market exposure. "My sense is that markets will have to fall a great deal further before there is any significant selling pressure," O'Neill said. Ironically the underlying reasons behind the Nikkei's malaise could even be indirectly positive for stocks here, strategists said, since slow economic growth makes less likely a feared rise in currently minimal Japanese interest rates. Japanese cash seeking higher returns in overseas bond markets was one of the motors behind the rise in some European bond markets during 1996, helping push up stock market prices. Japan has also historically been a major buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds, which set a benchmark for other world markets. "To the extent that it is virtually inconceivable that the Japanese authorities will consider higher short-term interest rates, it is a positive," said O'Neill at Capel. Even if rates rise, it may not be far enough to have a major impact on the flow of funds. "I don't think the flows are going to end," said Shah at Merrill, "I think we are going to have negligible rates in Japan for the foreseeable future." Fortune favours the brave, and Shah said pessimism over profit prospects was overdone, meaning that the all-encompassing gloom surrounding Japanese equities marks an opportunity for nimble European fund managers. "We think earnings are going to come in above expectations," Shah said, "we see a major buy opportunity opening up (in Japan) because of the sell-off."

CCAT	Israel may condition the purchase of a controlling stake in Bank Hapoalim on the buyer's agreeing to sell its full holdings in Koor Industries and Clal Israel, an official said on Thursday. "The idea is to investigate from a legal perspective if it is possible to oblige whoever buys the bank to sell off both holding companies," said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's economic adviser Moshe Leon. Netanyahu earlier this month rejected Leon's proposal to force the the divestiture prior to any sale on grounds it would delay the sale of Hapoalim, which is controlled by the government. The government is seeking to sell a controlling stake in the bank, Israel's largest. Hapoalim holds 22.7 percent of Koor and 30.9 percent of Clal, Israel's two largest holding companies. Leon had suggested the measure as an extension of the bank reform legislation requiring banks to reduce their holdings in non-bank companies and for Hapoalim to sell its stake in either Koor or Clal. He told Reuters that it would have taken a year for the bank to sell off its holdings in Koor and Clal. If transferring the obligation to the buyer is possible the bank could be sold within months, he said. Newspaper reports in recent weeks have said that two groups are forming to compete in a tender, one around U.S. banker Jeffrey Keil and the other around U.S.-Israeli entrepreneur Ted Arison.

GCAT	Anticipating a line of attack from Republican Bob Dole, President Bill Clinton on Saturday disclosed details of a controversial memo on the drug war that Republicans claim is critical of his leadership. Taking a break from his preparations to debate Dole on Sunday, Clinton told reporters the confidential memo by Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis Freeh simply argued for a reorganization of responsibilities within the government. "It was a memo by Mr. Louis Freeh to me arguing that the federal government had never been properly organised in terms of who had jurisdiction to do what in the drug war," Clinton said. "He argues for a reallocation of authority and I thought argued quite persuasively that we needed a way to coordinate this," Clinton said in a brief talk with reporters in this remote, lakeside town in western New York state. Clinton has refused to give the memo to congressional Republicans, claiming the legal doctrine of executive privilege. On Saturday, he seemed to suggest that the memo merely went over ground that had long been discussed within the U.S. government, saying: "This issue has been debated literally going back to the Johnson administration." In commenting on the letter, Clinton was clearly trying to deflect criticism from Republicans, including Dole, that his administration had not done enough to fight drugs. Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour called on Clinton on Saturday to make Freeh's memo public and said the White House had not been telling the truth about its handling of confidential FBI files on former Republican officeholders, the so-called Filegate scandal. "The Filegate scandal has proven the country cannot expect the truth from this White House," he said in a statement. "That's why it is crucial for the FBI/DEA memo to be made public, so the people can judge its importance themselves." Dole has made drugs a central theme of his campaign, often citing statistics that teen drug use has risen under Clinton, and running a string of television advertisements attacking the president on the issue. The Dole ads make a point of noting that at the start of his presidency Clinton sharply reduced the office of the drug policy director as part of his effort to reduce government spending. About three years later Clinton restored funds for the office and named Barry McCaffrey, a heavily decorated army general, to lead it. "One of the reasons that I wanted a general who had worked on drug interdiction as drug czar was to try to create a greater sense of coordination between the domestic law enforcement agencies, the military and all the people involved in the prevention and treatment side," he said. The Clinton campaign has about two dozen advisers gathered here to help him prepare for the 90-minute debate, which will begin at 9 p.m. EDT on Sunday (0100 GMT on Monday) in Hartford, Connecticut. The second, and final, debate between the two men before the Nov. 5 election is scheduled for Wednesday Oct. 16 in San Diego, California. Although national opinon polls show he leads Dole by 10-20 percentage points, Clinton has been playing an old political game by playing down his debating prowess to lower expectations in the debate. On Thursday he claimed to be "apprehensive" and on Friday he said former Maine Senator George Mitchell, who was impersonating Dole in Clinton's practice sessions, had "beat me like a drum." Asked on Saturday whether he had finally got the better of Mitchell, Clinton replied, "Well, I don't know. Maybe I got him to a draw." Clinton will be joined by his wife Hillary on Saturday afternoon at the 750-acre (303 hectare) retreat where he has secluded himself for three days to focus on the debate. On Sunday morning he will fly to Hartford, and take a tour of the debate hall in the afternoon to familiarize himself with its layout before the cameras start rolling on Sunday night.

GCAT	Colombian police smashed a heroin trafficking gang on Tuesday that smuggled the drug into the United States hidden in the stomachs of their recruits, a police spokesman said. Six of the eight people arrested in a southern neighbourhood of Bogota were thought to be the gang ringleaders, who recruited unemployed and destitute people to serve as smugglers, paying them with false passports, a U.S. visa and a small amount of cash, the spokesman said. Two of the detainees were being prepared for a drug run and were found to have swallowed as many as 90 capsules of heroin.
CCAT	Deposits at China's financial institutions reached 6,859.5 billion yuan ($826 billion) at the end of last year, up 1,479.2 billion yuan from the end of 1995, the official Financial News said on Tuesday. Deposits of the nation's enterprises in the financial system stood at 2,245.0 billion yuan, up 502.6 billion yuan from the end of 1995. Deposits of individuals in both rural and urban areas reached 3,852.0 billion yuan. That was an increase of 29.9 percent, the newspaper said. The newspaper, published by the central bank, also said total loans outstanding in the financial system were 6,115.6 billion yuan at the end of last year, up 1,068.3 billion yuan. Loans extended by state banks -- a term that usually refers only to the four main state-run banks -- increased by 793.7 billion or 20.4 percent. It gave no precise figures.

GCAT	A judge on Wednesday delayed the murder trial of an American couple, saying he needed to determine whether media coverage of the case in St. Vincent had prejudiced potential jurors. The trial of James Fletcher, 49, former president of a Huntington, West Virginia, mining equipment company, and his wife, Penny, 35, was to start on Wednesday. They were arrested and charged last October with the murder of water taxi driver Jerome "Jolly" Joseph. If convicted, they face death by hanging at a hilltop fort overlooking the Caribbean Sea. Eastern Caribbean High Court Judge Dunbar Cenac granted a prosecution motion to delay the highly publicised trial until a hearing on Monday to determine whether media reports had prejudiced potential jurors. The prosecution argued that the Fletchers and their lawyers have orchestrated a media smear campaign to discredit St. Vincent's legal system. "The nature of this publicity is to bias jurors and threaten the country with dire consequences if the trial does not go their way," prosecutor Karl Hudson-Phillips said. Cenac said he was enraged after watching CNN's "Burden of Proof" programme this week, in which Fletcher family members and lawyers appeared. As he was being led from the courtroom, James Fletcher said he was not surprised by the decision. "They want to delay it again. Obviously I'm very disappointed," he said. In the last week, St. Vincent authorities have charged one of the Fletchers' lawyers with contempt of court and detained and questioned another for criticising island officials. The Fletchers have been held in separate prisons since their arrests on Oct. 30 and have subsisted mainly on rations of rice and bread. The couple retired last year to sail around the world on their 47-foot yacht. They arrived in St. Vincent and the Grenadines last fall. Joseph, 30, ferried tourists from their boats to the island of Bequia, a prime Caribbean sailing destination near St. Vincent. On Oct. 6 he picked up the Fletchers for a late dinner. His bullet-riddled body was pulled from the water three days later.
GCAT	Commissioners in the tiny Florida island town of Longboat Key will meet with attorneys next week to discuss whether to appeal a jury award ordering it to pay a developer $8.8 million, the Bradenton Herald said Friday. The resort town of 7,000 year-round residents has annual property tax revenues of only $4.6 million and town officials said they do not have the money to pay the award. Town attorney David Perrson said Longboat Key had already spent $2.5 million in legal fees stemming from the case. A federal jury in Tampa awarded developer Murray Klauber $8.8 million on Thursday in his lawsuit against the city. Klauber has been battling the town since 1987 when it issued and then revoked his permit to build a $35 million spa on the Gulf Coast island. Klauber claimed that the revocation stemmed from his activism against a local government campaign to limit growth on the island. --Jane Sutton, 305-374-5013
ECAT	Despite a lower-than-expected 1.2-percent rise in Hungary's first quarter gross domestic product (GDP) on Tuesday, analysts said the government's 2.5- to three-percent GDP forecast for 1997 remains realistic. "Compared with earlier statistical date, based upon which we tried to forecast (GDP) for this year, the figure published today is low," said Zoltan Varadi of Daewoo Securities. "But I keep to my forecast of 2.5 percent GDP growth for 1997." The Central Statistical Office (KSH) said earlier on Tuesday GDP growth slowed to 1.2 percent in the first quarter from three percent last quarter. Household consumption rose 0.5 percent after a three-percent fall in fourth-quarter 1996 to post the first increase in years, the KSH said. Investment growth fell to 3.6 percent from six percent due to seasonal factors, but the KSH said it continued to see economic growth. Analysts agreed the drop in investments was seasonal but still had expected higher GDP figures. But they said the lower figures were probably due to uncertainties in the KSH's experimental GDP calculations and in other statistical data, such as retail trade. "It is clear that there are distortions in statistical figures," said Peter Muszely of Concorde Securities. He said the consumption rise was positive but also surprising after first-quarter figures showed a 10-percent fall in retail trade volume while real wages rose 7.2 percent and the net increase in household savings was lower than in the same period last year. "(KSH) disregard retail units employing less than 10 persons, and they could not fully follow yet a shift of demand towards (new) malls and large supermarkets," he said. Peter Bihari of Budapest Bank, who expected a higher figure for household consumption growth, said he expected the KSH to revise up earlier retail figures. He also said industrial output data for the beginning of the year suggested a higher GDP growth figure. March industry output rose 6.8 percent, year-over-year. That, coupled with predictions consumption and investments would pick up through the year, helped analysts remain optimistic that GDP growth would rise to 2.5 to three percent in 1997. "Real wages are rising more dynamically than anybody expected," Bihari said. "As a result, the differential between the rate of increase in imports and exports will even widen...and this will also stimulate the economy and lead to rising GDP growth." The KSH said exports rose 10.5 percent in the first quarter, while imports increased 12.6 percent. -- Budapest newsroom (36 1) 327 4040
ECAT	Germany has signed an agreement with Nepal to provide 8.2 billion rupees ($144.7 million) in non-refundable grants for development works in Nepal, officials said on Saturday. This includes the setting up of a hydro-electric plant. Finance Secretary Ram Binod Bhattarai told Reuters that the German grant included 5.7 billion rupees ($100.5 million), Bonn had earlier committed to Nepal for the controversial Arun III hydropower plant which was cancelled last year. "The German money will now finance the construction of the Middle Marsyangdi hydroelectric plant," Bhattarai said. The 42-megawatt Middle Marsyangdi project in Lamjung district in the western part of the Himalayan kingdom will be constructed on the Marsyangdi river, further upstream from an old powerhouse built with German assistance. Snow-fed rivers with a combined potential of producing up to 83,000 megawatts of electric power make Nepal one of the world's richest countries in water resources. But the kingdom generates only 293 megawatts of electricity against its peak hour demand of 302 megawatts, with the deficit being met through regular power cuts or imports from neighbouring India. The World Bank last year dropped $175 million support from its concessional arm, International Development Association, for the $764 million Arun III project in east Nepal to which Bonn was also contributing funds. Officials said Germany is studying development of the Arun valley, home to 450,000 people, most of them subsistence farmers, after the cancellation of the power plant which would have meant the construction of a 120-km (80-mile) long road giving them access to far-off markets and jobs. The German grant will also cover family planning activities to reduce the birth rate from the present 2.6 percent, construction of bridges and biogas plants in the kingdom, officials said. A consortium of Western donors in April this year pledged $1 billion, in grants and soft term loans, over the next two years for Nepal, which receives more than 60 percent of its development budget in foreign aid.
GCAT	Iran on Monday rejected charges by Afghanistan's Taleban militia which ordered Tehran to close its embassy in Kabul for alleged espionage, saying the mission had been held open for humanitarian reasons. "While other foreign countries had closed their embassies, the embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran was held open for humanitarian reasons," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said in remarks quoted by Tehran radio. "Iran is determined to continue its humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan and urges international organisations and other countries to help re-establish peace in Afghanistan," he added. An Afghan Foreign Ministry statement, quoted by official Kabul radio, said the embassy was closed "temporarily" and its staff were given 48 hours to leave Afghanistan. Iranian state radio earlier rejected the charges and dismissed the Taleban's action as a form of a retaliation for its recent "heavy defeats" in northern Afghanistan. Wakil Ahmad, a senior Taleban official in the southern city of Kandahar, told a Pakistan-based Afghan news service that the embassy had been "gathering wrong information" about Afghanistan. He said Tehran was not neutral in the Afghan conflict. The Iranian embassy has been among the very few diplomatic missions to remain open in Kabul throughout the factional fighting that has plagued the Afghan capital since Islamic guerrilla forces ousted a communist government in 1992. Shi'ite Moslem Iran has been uneasy at the emergence in neighbouring Afghanistan of the purist Sunni Moslem Taleban which Iranian media has blasted as being backed by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Iran has refused to recognise the Taleban government, which was set up after the militia captured Kabul in September last year, and still regards ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani as the legitimate Afghan president.

GCAT	Dutch champions Ajax Amsterdam have approached Danish striker Jon Dahl Tomasson to see if he will join them next season, the Dutch ANP news agency said on Friday. Tomasson, the Dutch first division's leading scorer this season with 16 goals, is under contract to Heerenveen until the summer of 1999 but has a get-out clause if a buyer offers seven million guilders ($3.7 million). Tomasson, who has recently broken into the Danish national squad, is seen as the likely replacement for Patrick Kluivert who leaves Ajax to join AC Milan at the end of this season. If Tomasson does opt for Ajax, he will team up with fellow Dane Morten Olsen, the European Cup semifinalists' new coach from next season.

ECAT	The World Bank on Friday said it was considering $290 million in loans to support economic reform efforts in Bulgaria. The possible new assistance follows discussions between Bank officials and a delegation from the Bulgarian goverment headed by interim prime minister Stefan Sofiyanski. The Bank said that it had been concerned with deteriorating conditions in Bulgaria over the past year and has been pleased to see the progress being made in dealing with the country's pressing problems.   "We recognize that the government's program for stabilization and reforms is ambitious but it offers an excellent chance for the turnaround of the economy and we are prepared to support the implementation of the comprehensive effort," the Bank said in a statement. The Bank statement follows an agreement this week between Bulgaria and the International Monetary Fund, which includes a $510 million one-year standby loan and other assistance. The IMF had suspended disbursements last year because of the former Socialist government's failure to meet reform targets. The three loans, which must be approved by the Bank board of directors, will be used, in part, to help buy critically needed imports of commodities that are in short supply as well as for enterprise and banking reforms.

MCAT	Benchmark 182nd cash Japanese government bonds were bought back on Friday after the release of weaker-than-expected forecasts of industrial output for August and September. Earlier, December futures closed slightly higher after shedding most of the day's gains, as Tokyo share prices recovered off the day's low. "Traders sold when Tokyo share prices rose back up above 20,100," said a trust bank trader. The December closed at 120.72, up from Thursday's 120.67. The yield of the benchmark 182nd cash JGB stood at 2.935 percent as of 0715 GMT.   The December contract's turnover was 57,799 contracts. In the Tokyo stock market, the key 225-share Nikkei average tumbled 386.26 points or 1.88 percent to end at 20,166.90. Earlier, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Japan's manufacturing output rose a preliminary 4.1 percent in July from the previous month, but was seen down 1.2 percent month-on-month in August, and output for September was seen up just 0.1 percent month-on-month. These figures confirmed the market's conviction that the Bank of Japan was unlikely to raise interest rates in the near future.

GCAT	The first of two women's World Cup downhill training runs scheduled on Thursday was delayed by two hours because of unforseen safety problems, organisers said on Thursday. According to organisers, more work had to be done on the Strohsack piste in order to provide the maximum safety for ski racers. The first practice run, originally scheduled for 0915 GMT, would now begin at 1100 GMT. Organisers were uncertain whether a second training run would be possible on Thursday. A warm weather front which softened the slope, led to the cancellation of a practice run in Bad Kleinkirchheim on Wednesday. International Ski Federation officials and local organisers spent all day on Wednesday mending the slope with a chemical used to harden snow. Bad Kleinkirchheim is due to host two downhills and a super-giant slalom from Friday to Sunday. The first downhill is the replacement for a race postponed in Crans Montana in December.

MCAT	Australian stocks ended barely changed on Tuesday with all eyes on the U.S. as traders waited to assess any rate implications of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting later today. The All Ordinaries Index shed a wafer-thin 0.3 points to 2,530.7. The trading pattern was just more of the same seen in the last few days, with the favoured key miners battling it out with a bank-weakened industrial grouping to produce the stalemate that was the day's finish. Bellwether and copper major Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd and diversified miner RTZ-CRA led the fight for the resources, both adding over one percent to A$19.26 (US$14.83) and A$21.12 respectively. "Without those two doing what they did, the statistics would be a lot worse," said broker Helen Michael, of Melbourne-based firm Peake Lands Kirwan. Other resource majors were not so lucky, with energy group Woodside Petroleum sliding two percent to A$10.94 after oil prices slipped offshore and as recent talk of potential takeovers evaporated. "There was a fair bit of anticipation and when it did not come about, people may have taken some profits," Michael said. Topping turnover was Austrim Ltd with 26.98 million shares traded, the bulk of it in a line of 13.18 million shares specialled twice at A$2.80 a share. The 9.2 percent stake is exactly equal to that owned by a private company associated with Seven Network chairman Kerry Stokes. Austrim shares ended nine cents higher at A$2.89. Food group Burns Philp & Co lost nine cents to A$1.87 amid concerns about its decision to sell more promising assets after Monday's restructuring announcement. Falls outnumbered rises by a ratio of about nine to seven, while about 33 percent of stocks traded remained steady. (A$1 = US$0.77)

"The specs had been nibbling at the market all day," a trader said. The July contract finished 0.24 cent higher at 73.21 cents per lb, having ranged from 73.25 to 72.75 cents. New-crop December closed 0.19 cent higher at 75.32 cents, while the rest of the board finished 0.55 to 0.08 cent firmer. Trading sources expect follow-through buying on Thursday, but said the trade should continue to resist gains. "We could see some early follow-through but the market will probably fail" to hold 73.00 cents, a dealer said, adding that gains were made amid volume estimated at only 8,000 lots. Tuesday's official volume was 8,851 lots, NYCE said. Talk of pest problems in Texas and declining certificated stocks may have lent support to the market, analysts said.

ECAT	Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash on Tuesday expressed concern at the lower than expected fall in the New Zealand dollar prices of imports in the September quarter and at the rise in monetary and credit aggregates. Statistics New Zealand data showed dollar prices of imports fell by 0.9 percent, markedly less than the 3.9 percent assumed by the bank in its projections in the monetary policy statement. "This forecast error follows a smaller, but still significant error in forecasting import prices in the June quarter," Brash said.
CCAT	Finnish electronics maker Vaisala Oy said in a statement on Monday it expected full-year 1996 net sales and operating profit to exceed the 1995 level. "The outlook for the end of the year is good. Last year's net sales and operating profit will be exceeded," Vaisala said. In 1995, group net sales were 417.4 million markka and operating profit was 83.2 million. In January-August, Vaisala's profit before extraordinary items and tax increased 35 percent to 79.3 million markka. Net sales rose 21 percent to 303.7 million markka. --Helsinki Newsroom +358 - 0 - 680 50 245
ECAT	Serbia wants to come to terms with its people over releasing more than $4 billion in old hard currency savings frozen since 1991, a senior government official said on Thursday. Two Serbian officials met representatives of various hard currency depositors' associations for the first time after six years and promised to include them in preparations of a state programme. "We met representatives of those associations and agreed in principle that our cooperation will be constructive and that the problem will be resolved by the federal government and with the help of republican governments," Serbian Minister for Economic and Ownership Transformation Milan Beko told Reuters. "The most important thing is to match the state's possibilities and the depositors's demands," he added. Beko, the first Serbian privatisation minister, will represent Serbia in a special work group set up by the federal government entrusted with readying a programme that will release 6.8 billion German marks in frozen deposits. But holders of those savings, many of them pensioners who in some cases deposited hundreds of thousands of German marks of their life-savings, seemed not too eager to accept any form of compensation other than cash. Rajko Grahovac, chairman of the Serbian Association of Old Hard Currency Depositors, welcomed the opportunity to talk to the government but said holders of those savings demand payment in the currency as deposited with banks. "I would be head over heels to get at least what I deposited," said a 60-year old pensioner who asked not to be named. Miodrag Banovic, president of another association, called on the government to amend its draft privatisation law so that holders of frozen savings can take part already in the first stage of the privatisation process. According to the new draft privatisation law, hard currency savings are to be activated for purchasing shares from Serbian Share Fund in the second stage of privatisation. The first meeting was expected to put an end to weeks of sporadic street protests by bitter holders of frozen savings. "We are glad that all those associations accepted to stop with their daily protests because they are satisfied with the way the Serbian government is tackling the issue," he added. But a group of pensioners, gathered in front of the Serbian government building, said they would continue with their daily protest. "We may slightly change the form of protest, but we shall keep on," one pensioner said. -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254
MCAT	The FTSE 100 index will seek support near 4,660 on Thursday and then drift up to around 4,680, technical analysts said. This continues the soft tone set on Wednesday when it looked as if the market had abandoned any plans for a swift move up into record territory. But after having climbed about 250 points since the start of the month -- which averages to 30 points a day --- this upward pace will be difficult to sustain, analysts added. By 0738 GMT, the FTSE was down 18.9 points at 4,668.0.   Retail banks will try to claw bank early losses as will pharmaceuticals -- two sectors which have been leading the market higher for several weeks. Support may also come from the retail sector while some shares in engineering groups will begin to slow their rate of decline and to form a base from which they can make a slight revival. But worries over interest rates will keep the market from rushing ahead today and its nervousness will be apparent by wild movements in underlying shares, analysts said. -- Pradip Mishra, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7954
CCAT	Backers of a $250 million stadium for the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team warned Thursday that a bill pending before the Wisconsin Legislature to cap debt issuance for the project could doom the stadium, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinal reported Friday. Brewers President Bud Selig said that the measure would kill the stadium project and in turn, major league baseball in the state, according to the newspaper. Robert Trunzo, chairman of the Southeast Wisconsin Professional Baseball Park District board, which is overseeing the project, echoed those sentiments, saying the bill could kill the deal, the newspaper reported. The reactions followed a report Thursday that Gov. Tommy Thompson would sign into law a bill pending before the state Senate that would cap debt backed by a five-county, 0.1 percent sales tax at $160 million. It would also prohibit the use of the revenues to pay off leases for stadium equipment. The district sold $146.7 million of tax-exempt sales tax revenue bonds on March 5. One district board member, Ulice Payne, reportedly suggested this week that the bill's passage could lead bondholders to demand their money back. ((--Karen Pierog, 312-408-8647))

MCAT	IPE Brent dipped into the red on Tuesday afternoon as falling NYMEX heating oil futures encouraged a retracement of modest early gains, brokers said. March Brent was trading 21 cents down at $22.33 a barrel at 1646 GMT, just off a session low of $$22.30. "It was stuck in a range, but overall things looked weaker as heating oil came off. We came up earlier in pretty thin volume so it was easy to lose it again," said one floor broker. After opening stronger, NYMEX heating oil had made a push for the upside but quickly shed gains to trade over one cent a gallon lower. IPE Feb gas oil also slumped from early highs, trading $1.50 cents down at $202.50 a tonne at 1646 GMT, from a session high of $208.25. Forecasts for above-normal temperatures in the U.S. Northeast, the world's key heating oil market, undermined oil markets on both sides of the Atlantic, brokers said.

CCAT	Britons can bank on the phone, bank on the internet, bank with a PC and bank while they shop but the proliferation of financial services only betrays serious doubts about what the future holds. The crux of the matter is that Britain is over-banked and even more players are lining up to enter the fray. The question for the industry is how to reduce expensive, routine banking operations and sell more "product", like insurance or pensions, while not alienating the customers to an unacceptable degree. The recent tie-up between supermarket chain J. Sainsbury and the Bank of Scotland is an illustration of the thinking going on in panelled boardrooms. The bank, lightweight in its exposure outside its Scottish stronghold, needed to find a way of extending its customer base into England and Wales. One obvious alternative, to buy customers from a bank or a building society, would have been expensive with no guarantee of success. The food retailer needed to satisfy an apparent customer demand for banking services to be present "in-store". At a stroke, the demands of Sainsbury's customers will be met, at least partially, and Bank of Scotland will have a potential 12 million customers to sell things to. Profits will be shared. Independent strategist Catherine Smith says retailers and possibly new intermediaries like Microsoft or BT are likely to take on more and more of the routine payments, cashing and deposit-taking business with their relatively sophisticated technology. "Banks might be better off in the long run because that side of the business is loss-making," Smith said. But she also points out that for a long time, bankers have had an almost religious belief that, unless they provide the nitty-gritty, everyday services, then they cannot hope to sell money-making products like insurance and pensions. "The decisive factor will the ability of banks to walk away from loss-making business," said Smith. "Strength of character to make fundamental decisions and a strong capital position to withstand a price war will also be important." And banks have been walking away. From branches, for example. National Westminster announced 300 closures earlier this year and the merger of Lloyds and TSB will likely lead to large scale closures, especially if their claims for cost savings are to be realised. But closing branches and putting everyone on the telephone isn't always the best way. Some people still like to actually talk to their bank manager face to face (and vice versa, of course). Barclays chief executive Martin Taylor is nervous of unthinking closure ideas. "Having high-cost branches is the disadvantage," Taylor told Reuters in an interview earlier this year. "The marginal three or four hundred branches are not a big deal." The speed at which closures happen for Taylor is a function of what revenue they produce. Low cost branches can be kept open for longer but closing them will not save very much anyway. "If I heard that our competitors were closing down half their branches, I'd regard that as good news, as an opportunity," Taylor added. In all of this, it's hard not to see internet banking and PC banking generally as rather a side-show. No doubt they make it easier for the customer to keep a handle on account details, direct payments and other routine aspects, but its hard to see how any more complex financial product could be actually sold down these channels although they may help provide sales prospects. Increasingly, the great British public are going to have to make personal provision for old-age as the State finds it more and more difficult to fund such massive programmes. But even with that expansion, Smith says that the inescapable crunch will come because there is simply not enough business to go round. Britain's traditional banks are now ranged against insurance companies, many of which have far better selling experience than the banks, and an increasing number of building societies who are converting to bank status and floating on the stock exchange. Some of these are very big. Take the Halifax, Britain's largest home mortgage lender, for example. Add to these, the brand-based sellers of financial products such as Virgin and Marks & Spencer, and you have a deregulated financial services sector where something will have to give. Further mergers and takeovers seem inevitable, though the size of some of the present players makes this problematical, and even the prospect of cross-border mergers in Europe is thought a possibility by some who see these being facilitated by European monetary union, if that ever comes. But many still feel that cultural barriers and brand loyalties make this a difficult nut to crack. The Bank of Scotland/Sainsbury solution begins to look more and more logical and could be used on a larger scale. Barclays is already co-operating with Microsoft on Microsoft's Money 97 software, a tie-up which allows Barclays customers to drop their financial details into a home finance software programme. What price "Barclays Microsoft Bank"?
GCAT	Zaki Badr, an Egyptian interior minister who won notoriety in the late 1980s for his blunt speech and brutal approach to the Islamist opposition, died on Thursday of natural causes, official sources said. He was 71. Badr, a police general who served as minister from 1986 to 1990, was widely criticised at the time for introducing practices such as indiscriminate arrests and beating prisoners. But it was his crude language and behaviour that most caught the public's attention. Speaking of his Islamist opponents, he once said: "I see them as mad dogs -- with all respect to dogs." President Hosni Mubarak sacked him in January 1990, days after a Cairo newspaper published in full the obscene epithets he had used to describe intellectuals, writers and politicians. Badr was born in the Nile Delta province of Menoufia in February 1926 and spent all his career in the police force. "I am an old security man and I speak my mind frankly. It is a grave mistake to deal with these people (fundamentalist dissidents) through dialogue. My dialogue with those using weapons is through weapons," he once said.
GCAT	South African rugby supremo Louis Luyt is to be challenged for the job of Transvaal Rugby Union president by his deputy Brian van Rooyen, a coloured official who will mount the first opposition to Luyt since 1988. "Luyt runs Transvaal rugby like it is his private reserve," said Van Rooyen, currently Luyt's vice-president. "There is no transparency and the members of the TRU executive are treated like rubber stamps for what he decides in advance. I am nobody's puppet." He said he was confident of winning the vote at a TRU meeting on Monday. "There is a clear majority who want change...it's clearly not only in our province where Dr Luyt's influence is not wanted anymore." Luyt, also president of the South African Rugby Football Union, is frequently accused of running the sport with an autocratic hand.

An ARIG statement said Arab Tunisian Group (ATIG) had a paid-in capital of three million Tunisian dinars ($2.7 million) and would deal with all types of insurance related to construction. ARIG is a major shareholder in ATIG which is expected to receive permission to underwrite other insurance activities, including medical and life, it added. Bahrain-based ARIG, owned by the governments of Libya, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, plans to offer shares worth some $180 million to private investors later this year.

GCAT	Bahrain's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammad bin Mubarak al-Khalifa left on Sunday for Saudi Arabia to attend reconciliation talks with neighbouring Qatar, the official Gulf News Agency reported. He and the Qatari foreign minister, who was already in Riyadh, were expected to sign a memorandum of understanding on Sunday night to end a war of words between the two Gulf Arab neighbours, according to a Gulf diplomatic source. Bahrain and Qatar have been locked in a border dispute over a number of small Gulf islands controlled by Bahrain since the 1930s but also claimed by Qatar. The seven-point document has been drafted by regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia, which heads a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) mediation committee that also includes the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait and Oman. The committee was due to meet in Riyadh on Sunday evening. The GCC also groups Bahrain and Qatar. Bahrain's Cabinet Affairs and Information Minister Mohammad Ibrahim al-Mutawae said in remarks published on Sunday that Manama was ready to back the deal if it helped improve bilateral ties with Doha. "If there is any signing on anything that achieves stronger ties, then Bahrain is willing," Mutawae told the UAE newspaper al-Khaleej when asked if Manama would sign the deal. "We are going to the meeting with an open heart to maintain the everlasting links with the brotherly people of Qatar and we hope bilateral ties will return to normal," he added. The Gulf diplomatic source told Reuters on Friday the deal would commit the two sides to refrain from making "wild charges" against each other but would not address the border row. Qatar took the territorial dispute to the International Court of Justice at The Hague in 1991, a move opposed by Bahrain which insists on an Arab solution. Ties were further strained after Bahrain last month accused two Qataris of spying and boycotted the GCC's December summit to protest against Doha's refusal to withdraw the case from the court. Doha denied they were spies. Later in December Bahrain pardoned the two Qataris after a court sentenced them to three years in jail for spying.
MCAT	Swiss shares gave up some of their early gains in the second half of the session but closed slightly higher on Monday after a friendly Wall Street opening gave them a late boost. Dealers hoped U.S. economic data due this week would add pep to slow trading, but investors were likely to remain cautious as U.S. presidential elections draw closer, one trader said. The blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) ended up 4.8 points, or 0.13 percent, at 3,763.5 points. The all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) added 2.07 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,415.26 points. Union Bank of Switzerland, the country's biggest bank, advanced six Swiss francs to 1,240 after reporting cash flow and group profit roise in the first nine months of the year. UBS said it was cautiously optimistic about the year as a whole, but that provisions remained higher than expected. Dealers said the level of provisions was disappointing. CS Holding also firmed while Swiss Bank Corp lost ground. Among insurers, Swiss Re continued to profit from favourable figures of German competitor Muenchner Rueck, adding four francs to 1,361. Baloise jumped 2.29 percent to 2,680 francs as banks stepped up purchases, traders said. Most industrials were little changed. Roche certificates were up 15 francs at 9,615 in active trade. Watchmaker SMH bearer shares put on six francs to 792 after several buy recommendations. Swissair slumped 1.11 percent to 980 francs on investors' worries over the outcome of Belgian Sabena's talks with its unions, a dealer noted. Swissair has a 49.5 percent stake in Sabena. Watchmaker TAG Heuer soared 7.25 francs to 219.25, possibly due to purchases by a U.S. or British broker, a dealer said.
CCAT	Nike Inc said Monday it had adjusted its production capacity lower but said that was not a sign of a downturn in demand. Nike was responding to a downgrade from Smith Barney analyst Faye Landes, who said a recent trip she made to Hong Kong and China led her to believe that Nike cut its production forecasts. "What she is focussing on has nothing to do with a downturn in the market," said Jim Small, a spokesman for Nike.   Small said that Nike has seen such explosive growth in recent years that if it expects growth of 25 percent, for example, it might book 50 percent excess capacity in case demand is even stronger than anticipated. Small reiterated that fourth quarter orders were still 34 percent above the comparable year-ago quarter. "Future orders are still very strong at 34 percent, which in any business is tremendous growth," Small said. In Nike's third quarter earnings report in March it reported record future orders for delivery between March and July was 34 percent above the year-ago quarter.   In her report Landes said her sources believed Nike has told its plants in China and Indonesia to cut footwear production beginning in May and through June and July. She said the cuts could reduce footwear production, which accounts for two-thirds of company revenues, by over 20 percent. She said that she suspected demand in the United States might be slowing at a quicker rate than Nike had previously forecast and that the possibility of Nike maintaining the explosive growth it has seen in recent years has been significantly reduced.   Small said those suspicions were unfounded. "That just doesn't hold true, there is nothing in the numbers that is backing up what she is saying," he said. Small said the reduction in production capacity has no impact on earnings or revenue projections.
MCAT	New York precious metals futures ended sharply lower Tuesday, as US stock and bond markets recovered some ground lost last week, with US dollar surging to new multi-year highs also. "After four days in which gold recovered about $10.00 and silver about 30 cents, we were probably due for a correction, and the recovery in the stock and bond market today helped, but most of the rally last week in gold looked like fund shortcovering anyway," Refco New York analyst Jim Steel said. COMEX February gold ended down $3.30 an ounce at $354.00, well off its intraday high at $358.20.   In the past four days February gold had recovered from a contract low at $347.30, while spot gold in the bullion market had been recovering from a three year low around $347.00. Spot gold ended Tuesday quoted $352.90/40 an ounce, compared to the London Tuesday afternoon fix at $353.70 and the London morning fix at $357.25. US treasury bonds recovered from several days of losses on a better-than-expected US fourth quarter employment cost index rise of 0.8 percent, allowing US equity markets to recover also, removing the need for diversification into hard assets, analysts said. "Prospects that a low inflation environment will support higher equity values suggest that disinvestment of gold will remain in vogue in 1997," Smith Barney analyst David Rinehimer said. However, much of recovery in the past few days, may have been caused by fund short covering, analysts said. Commodity funds had been holding near-record net short positions in gold in recent CFTC Commitments of Traders data. But in data released Tuesday, open interest in COMEX gold futures fell 4,129 lots Monday, after a fall of 5,336 lots Friday. February gold open interest fell 9,618 lots Monday, ahead of the contract's delivery period starting January 31. April gold open interest rose 5,636 lots though, as some short positions were rolled forward, traders said. The ongoing rally in the US dollar was also doing little for dollar denominated hard assets in other currencies, analysts said. The US dollar hit a fresh 31 month high against the mark and a new 47 month high against yen Tuesday. As a result gold priced in yen rose further Tuesday to its highest levels for a month. "Continued US dollar gains against yen are expected to limit any recovery in Japanese gold demand," Rinehimer said. For the first 11 months of 1996, Japan's gold imports totalled 126 tonnes, nearly half of the 250 tonnes imported in the same period in 1995. Meanwhile, in recent weeks the South African rand has recovered from multi-year lows against the dollar, lowering the gold price in rand terms to nine month lows, and putting pressure on South African gold miners to hedge some of their production. The bounce in gold and silver in the past week, was led by silver which has a slightly better supply/demand outlook, analysts noted. But the spot gold/silver ratio saw its first bounce in a week Tuesday, ending at 71.31, after sliding to a nine month low at 70.84 Friday. COMEX March silver ended down 8.4 cents an ounce Tuesday at $4.963, well off its intraday highs at $5.060. Earlier spot silver in the bullion market had fixed at $5.03 an ounce in London, its highest level since October 14. Gold was slightly stronger than platinum also Tuesday, with the April NYMEX platinum/COMEX gold ratio ratio ending at $4.50 an ounce, down from $5.10 Friday. NYMEX April platinum closed down $3.80 an ounce at $360.20, while NYMEX March palladium ended down $1.05 an ounce at $124.65. -Clive McKeef, New York Commodities Desk, +1-212-859-1641; -email: clive.mckeef@reuters.com

GCAT	Nicu Ceausescu, who died on Thursday in a Vienna hospital, was a hard-drinking womaniser whose playboy reputation once symbolised the moral bankruptcy of his father's Romanian communist dictatorship. The 45-year-old youngest son of Nicolae Ceausescu, executed in Romania's December 1989 revolution, had been suffering from serious liver disease. He was flown to Austria a week ago for specialised surgery after Romanian doctors acknowledged they lacked medical and surgical equipment to deal with his condition. He had been rushed to the Bucharest university hospital on September 14 with internal bleeding, caused by what doctors said was a varicose oesophagus and acute liver cirrhosis. He was believed to be on the waiting list for a liver transplant when he died. Under his father's rule, Nicu enjoyed a playboy lifestyle and squandered vast sums of public money at the gambling tables of Las Vegas and other casino towns. Nicu was the youngest of the three children of the late dictator and his wife Elena. He was his father's political heir apparent and was communist party boss in the central Romanian town of Sibiu until Nicolae Ceausescu's downfall. In his palatial villa he indulged a ferocious appetite for excess: women, drink and wild parties were the norm. A reluctant member of his entourage was Olympic gymnast Nadia Comaneci. A violent revolution in 1989 ousted the Ceausescus after a ruthless 24-year rule. Nicolae and Elena were shot by firing squad on Christmas Day. Nicu, a physicist, was head of the Communist Party's youth wing and was posted to Sibiu in the early 1980s, where local people remember him for trying to resist his father's severe economic belt-tightening policies. Shortly before his parents' execution, he was arrested and charged with ordering troops to fire on demonstrators in Sibiu during the uprising and with illegal possession of firearms. Nicu denied the charge, saying he had already left town when troops opened fire killing 91 people and wounding 208. He was jailed for 20 years in September 1990 after being convicted for "instigating aggravated murder" and illegally possessing a firearm. By the time of his release on health grounds in November 1992, he had served half of the jail term -- enough for parole based on good behaviour. Romanian prosecutors earlier this year closed the file on a criminal probe launched against the Ceausescu children in the wake of the anti-communist revolution. They were cleared of charges of undermining the national economy -- charges on which their parents were killed -- by using their privileged position to exploit assets of the now defunct Communist Party. A foreign travel ban on the children was also lifted. Many Romanians now harbour ambivalent feelings about the Ceausescu era and their fall. Living standards are lower and many people believe the true story of the 1989 revolution -- which many see as a coup d'etat by former communists who have held power ever since -- has yet to be told. Nicu is survived by his brother Valentin, a nuclear physicist, and his sister Zoe, a mathematician. Both have kept a low profile since they were released from detention in 1990.
ECAT	Singapore has revised downwards its 1996 forecast gross domestic product (GDP) growth to six percent and expects 1997 growth of between five to seven percent, with exports hit by a weak electronics sector. The latest revision is the third by the city-state this year, is down from a forecast of seven to eight percent growth made in August. Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also revealed that third quarter GDP growth was only 3.2 percent, down sharply from the second quarter's 7.5 percent. Lee told a trade award ceremony that Singapore's economy had been affected by the global slowdown in the electronics sector caused by a softening in demand, excess capacity and an oversupply of components. "Given the weak third quarter, continued weakness in global electronics demand and the high production levels of fourth quarter 1995, the Ministry of Trade & Industry has revised its forecast of 1996 growth down, to about 6 percent," he said. Lee said the electronics industry was going through a cyclical slowdown. Since electronics accounts for 44 percent of value added in the manufacturing  sector, the Singapore economy has been significantly affected, he said. The latest government forecast for 1996 GDP growth is lower than that expected by many economists. A recent Reuters poll of 11 economists averaged a 6.4 percent forecast rise in 1996 GDP, and third quarter growth slightly over 3.0 percent year-on-year. Lee said the MTI's assessment is that the current economic slowdown in Singapore is cyclical. "It reflects a cyclical slowdown in external demand, rather than structural problems in the Singapore economy." Lee noted that foreign investment commitments in Singapore remain strong. The Economic Development Board (EDB) attracted Singapore $6.4 billion (US$4.54 billion) of investments in the first nine months of the year. For the year as a whole, EDB expects to exceed its target of S$7.5 billion of investments, and set a new record of S$8 billion, said Lee. Lee said since the government's assessment is that the slowdown is mainly cyclical and has not been caused by a loss of competitiveness, it will not need to make any drastic policy adjustments to cope with the downturn. Lee said the outlook for 1997 would depend on how quickly the electronics industry picks up worldwide. "This is difficult to predict, although the industry consensus is that it will happen by the second half of 1997. "Assuming this materialises, MTI expects the economy to grow in 1997 by five to seven percent, slightly lower than our medium term growth potential of six to eight percent," he said.

GCAT	President Laurent Kabila's troops on Tuesday surrounded the house of veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi in the Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa, family members said. Two trucks full of soldiers, armed with automatic weapons, emptied into the streets around the house in the Limete suburb and stayed for about three hours before leaving, they said. "When I went out I asked their commander what they were doing, but he refused to answer," Marthe Tshisekedi, the opposition leader's wife, told Reuters. Opposition militants outside the house said the soldiers left at around 6.p.m. (1700 GMT) but had vowed to return during the night. They said they feared there were plans to arrest Tshisekedi, who has spoken out against Kabila for giving himself sweeping powers since ousting former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last month. Tshisekedi, who claims to be prime minister on the basis of a 1992 national conference, has also called for the withdrawal of Rwandan and other foreign troops from Kabila's army. Kabila's ruling alliance has banned political activity in Kinshasa and troops have broken up protest marches organized by Tshisekedi's supporters. Opposition militants say they will continue to defy the ban and will march on Friday.
CCAT	Swedish pharmaceutical heavyweight Astra AB on Wednesday chalked up a ten percent increase in 1996 earnings and analysts forecast continued health, dismissing worries about expiring Losec patents. Astra reported a rise pre-tax profit to 13.2 billion crowns ($1.8 billion), on the back of a sales increase of nine percent to 38.99 billion crowns. In a Reuters poll, analysts expected a profit of 13.17 bilion. "The report was fairly undramatic and in line with forecasts," said Paul Hansson, analyst at Nordbanken. At fixed currency rates, profit and sales rose 17 percent. "At fixed foreign exchange rates, growth was larger in the fourth quarter, particularly in the respiratory area," Claus Moller, analyst at Aros Securities, told Reuters. "This strong growth could continue in the first quarter of 1997," he said, adding that he forecast a 17 percent sales growth this year. Fourth quarter sales rose 19 percent to 10.85 billion crowns, including foreign exchange movements, Astra said. The company also proposed a one for three stock dividend and a two for one stock split. "This is a way to turn balance sheet profits to share capital...we think shareholders will welcome the free shares," Astra spokesman Steffan Ternby told Reuters. But analysts did not expect the moves to have a long term effect, saying the report itself should benefit the share more. Analysts expected Astra to keep growing, pointing to several new drugs and dismissing concerns about Astra's patents on its blockbuster anti-ulcer drug Losec expiring. "Worries that the expiration of the Losec patent will have a serious impact on Astra are exaggerated," Gustav Rhenman, analyst at Ohman brokerage told Reuters. "There is a lot to do on the volume side and in the year 2001 Astra's product portfolio will be much stronger." Losec patents will expire in 2001 in the U.S., followed by Britain in 2002, Germany and Sweden in 2003, and France, Japan and Spain in 2004. "When the patents expire we will start seeing 60-70 percent price falls in countries affected and Losec sales will fall by 10-15 percent annually after 2001," Rhenman said. Astra's sales of Losec rose 23 percent to 17.56 billion crowns last year, while worldwide Losec sales, including sales by licensees, rose 17 percent to 24.63 billion crowns. But as three of four ulcer patients are treated with old medication, Rhenman said Astra could make up for the price fall by boosting sales volumes. Furthermore, Astra has several strong products in its portfolio already, analysts said. They pointed to anti-asthma medication Oxis Turbuhaler, Lexxel, which treats high blood pressure, the anaesthesia Naropin and anti-impotence agent MUSE, anti-osteoporosis ALX1-11 and Rofleponide for asthma. "Rofleponide will mean a revolution in asthma treatment as it means smaller doses and less growth disturbances for children," Rhenman said. ($ = 7.448 Swedish Crowns)
CCAT	Apple Computer Inc is expected to rehire co-founder Steven Jobs to help the computer company update its operating system software, according to a published report Friday. The Los Angeles Times, citing unidentified sources, said Jobs will be hired as a part-time consultant and "technology guru" in charge of the software project.  The newspaper said an announcement could come later today.   Jobs, who founded Apple with Stephen Wozniak, was ousted in 1985 after a power struggle with then chief-executive John Sculley. The newspaper said Jobs would supervise the launch of the new Macintosh operating system, an eagerly awaited software update that is regarded as a critical step in Apple's future. A spokesman for Apple was not immediately available to comment.

GCAT	Former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton, who celebrates his 1,000th English league appearance this weekend, has been named for an award by the sponsors of the domestic premier league. Shilton, 47, plays for Leyton Orient against Brighton in the third division on Sunday. He won an England record 125 international caps and has been part of the national game for more than 30 years. England manager Glenn Hoddle, a member of the Carling No 1 award panel, paid tribute to Shilton, whose league clubs have included Leicester, Stoke, Nottingham Forest, Southampton and Derby. "Peter has been an outstanding servant of the game with every club he has played at and of course England," Hoddle said. "He has the respect and friendship of a whole host of people in the game. His record speaks for itself and Sunday will be a very special day for him." Gordon Banks, England's goalkeeper in the 1966 World Cup victory, said: "This is a fantastic achievement which will never be equalled again in the professional game. "At 15, Peter was extraordinarily gifted and hard work turned this gift into exceptional talent. He was so good as my understudy, Leicester sold me to Stoke and then Leicester beat us the following season." Previous winners of the award include Stanley Matthews and Alan Shearer.
ECAT	Mexico said on Wednesday that cutting its unpopular value added tax (VAT) would put a hole in the budget that would not be filled by marginal rises in other taxes. Mexican opposition parties, flexing their muscles after dealing a blow to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in mid-term elections, have been agitating for the tax to be slashed to 10 from 15 percent to make good their campaign promises. But Finance Ministry officials say this would put an enormous gap in the national budget and say opposition proposals to make up for it are inadequate. "There is no way to compensate for so big a loss, (which would be) in the order of 25 billion pesos," said Tomas Ruiz, president of Mexico's System of Tax Administration (SAT). "A loss of such a magnitude cannot be made up for via the limited impact measures that have been suggested so far." Raising taxes on luxury goods or maquiladora (assembly plant) industries, or ending the zero tax on medicines, would not be enough to make up the deficit, which he said would total one percent of gross domestic product. Lowering the tax would also create imbalances at state and municipal level -- some six billion pesos are earmarked for state and municipal governments, he said. "Public finances would fall into imbalance which is delicate because the federal goverment would have no alternative but to look for other sources of compensation, or end up with a deficit much higher than expected," Ruiz said. The Mexican Institute of Finance Executives (IMEFF) said that if the government cut the tax it would still have to balance the books so as not to jeopardise Mexico's economic recovery. "It is necessary that whatever modification is made to the tax system takes as its basis the balance between revenues and spending," IMEFF said in a statement on Wednesday. "Not doing so could put in danger the economic recovery achieved so far." ((--Karina Balderas, Mexico City newsroom +525 728 9562))
CCAT	CompUSA Inc said on Wednesday it approved a two-for-one split of its common stock. The two-for-one split, the company's second in 1996, will be in the form of a 100 percent common stock dividend to be mailed December 2, 1996 to stockholders of record on November 18, 1996. About 91 million shares of CompUSA's common stock will be outstanding after the split, the company said.
CCAT	Drugstore chain Benavides will close 1996 with 485 stores operating in 104 cities and 16 states across Mexico, a company spokeswoman told Reuters. "We will open 36 new stores in 1996, 20 of them on the (U.S.) border, with which we will have 485 in operation," she said. In April, the firm said it had 449 stores. Benavides does not intend to make inroads into new markets with the new stores, however. "We decided to consolidate our presence in those places where do business," she added. In June,  Benavides completed the acquisition of the El Paseo chain of ten drugstores, at a cost of 3.5 million pesos, according to the spokeswoman. "As of June 30, therefore, we had 132,956 square metres of sales floor space," she added. Benavides has a four percent share of the Mexican market in drugstore chains, making it the largest in Mexico, the spokeswoman said. Nonetheless, she added, "In the 16 states where we have a market presence, our share is 11.5 percent." -- Daniel Perez, Monterrey newsroom +528 342-8730
MCAT	Singapore shares surrendered gains late on Tuesday in a bout of profit taking, but a bullish mood for electronics remained intact, dealers said. "It's just a minor correction. The market should go into a consolidative phase now," a securities dealer said, noting there was still demand for selected large capital issues. Early buying was triggered by a strong Wall Street overnight and concurrent strength in regional bourses on Tuesday. The Straits Times Industrials Index ended 0.87 points up at 2,246.59, off from the session's 2,263 high on a brisk turnover of 159.8 million shares. Gainers outpaced losers by 191 to 173.   Some blue chip foreign stocks sustained interest over the day, but most succumbed to profit taking. Top gainers included SPH Foreign at Singapore $28.70, up $0.30 and UOB Foreign at $16.40, up $0.30. SIA rose on news the company might float some of its units. SIA Foreign ended at $13.00, up $0.20, and SIA Ltd at $17.40, up 20 cents. Among the losers were Cycle & Carriage at $17.50, down $0.40, and Creative Technology at $14.90, down $0.30. Multimedia Aztech dominated the actives, rising half a cent to $0.565, and Wong's Circuits rose US$0.05 to US$1.14. --Jacqueline Wong (870 3088)
MCAT	CME hog futures were expected to open steady to 0.200 cent per lb lower while calls ranged mixed from 0.250 cent a lb lower to 0.250 higher for pork belly futures, livestock analysts said. Further profit taking was expected in hog futures stemming from an easier tone to cash hog prices early Wednesday. The market still looked overbought after the three days of limit gains which were sparked by the ban on pork exports from Taiwan, analysts said. However, the Taiwan situation will remain a supporting factor, they said. The disease there continues to spread with 716 breeding centers reporting infected hogs as of Wednesday and estimates that about 15 percent of the country's 11-million-head hog population would be affected directly.   Calls ranged mixed on pork belly futures with some analysts looking for pressure linked to an easier tone to cash bellies while others considered the market oversold and cited Tuesday's mildly bullish CME Out-of-Town Report for support. The CME reported a net in-movement into approved warehouses outside Chicago of 926,000 lbs in its weekly report, less than early estimates of in 1.0 million to 2.0 million lbs. Evening of positions was expected to continue in both pits ahead of Thursday's quarterly USDA Hogs and Pigs report. Analysts' estimates for all hogs on U.S. farms averaged 99.2 percent of a year ago in a range of 97 to 100.9 percent. Hogs kept for breeding estimates averaged 101.4 percent of a year ago and ranged 98.5 to 104 and hogs kept for market averaged 99 percent and ranged 96 to 100.8 percent. ((Jerry Bieszk 312-408-8725))
CCAT	Paging firm Philippine Wireless Inc (PWI) said on Wednesday it expects to sign an agreement with the Usha Group before year-end for the setting up of a paging company in India. The proposed firm, Telecom Informatics India Pvt Ltd, will start operations of its paging service in three cities namely Bhopal, Coimbatore and Patna by the first quarter of 1997. "We look at this as our entry point in the Indian market. If government opens up paging service in bigger cities, then we will participate either through a joint venture with Usha or with other telecom firms,"  Emmanuel T. Castillo, PWI executive vice-president told Reuters. PWI was the first to offer a paging service in the Philippines which now has a total of 11 paging companies. - Manila newsroom 63 2 8418938 fax 8176267

GCAT	Norway's Kjetil-Andre Aamodt collected the fourth gold and 11th medal of his career on Thursday when he won the men's combined title at the Alpine skiing world championships. The former Olympic super-giant slalom champion and 1993 world slalom and giant slalom champion clocked a total time of three minutes 10.40 seconds over the two- race event which comprises a downhill and slalom. It was Norway's second gold of the championships in just two men's events raced so far. Atle Skaardal retained his super-G title on Monday. Switzerland's Bruno Kernen was second in 3:10.68 while Austria's Mario Reiter took bronze in 3:11.69. Overall World Cup leader Aamodt had been in third place after the first leg of the slalom, raced under floodlights on the Kandahar piste, and he must have felt destined for a lower position on the podium. "I was very angry after the first run so I gave it everything in the second," said Aamodt. "Finally I have won this gold." Norway's Lasse Kjus, the man who beat him into second place in the combined in both the 1994 Winter Olympics in front of his home crowd in Lillehammer and the 1993 world championships, had been more than half a second ahead. But Kjus, who won a silver in the opening super-G on Monday to confirm his return to form after illness, made several mistakes in the second leg and finished fifth. "I don't know what happened to me in the second run," he said. "I was surprised by my good first run but in the second I had no feeling for the speed. I was too passive." He and Aamodt are great friends, once dubbed the "Dream Team" because they shared a room and a reputation for forgetfulness in the early days of their ski careers. Aamodt's 11 medals, six from four world championships and five in Olympics, lifts him alongside the legendary Pirmin Zurbriggen of Switzerland and Toni Sailer of Austria. Only the 1996 combined world champion Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg, who has not competed since December due to injury, has won more among the men -- a total of 13. Girardelli was not in Sestriere due to injury and is expected to announce his retirement here next week. If Kjus's failure to step onto the podium alongside his friend was a surprise, so was Kernen's silver. "To ski so well in this race is a big surprise for me," said the Swiss, who has never before won a medal and who crashed heavily in a downhill in Wengen in January. He said his medal represented a remarkable recovery. Reiter's bronze, his second medal after a slalom silver in Sierra Nevada last year, was also a recovery from the disappointment of finishing fourth in the combined last year. He blamed his skis that time, having led the event after the slalom only to blow it all in the downhill stage. The combined is a simple addition of times from the two races. "This will free me for the slalom," said the Austrian, who missed a nighttime slalom on home snow in Schladming last week because he had a heavy cold. He won a World Cup slalom in Kitzbuehel last month to clinch his place in the national team, something that had looked doubtful before his first and only win of the season. As last year, Reiter won the slalom event by a healthy margin, and was the only skier on the icy piste to clock a time inside 45 seconds in the second leg. Austrian speed specialist Werner Franz led after the downhill on the Kandahar Banchetta course but came to grief as many had expected on the nearby slalom piste. Austria's big hope, 32-year-old Guenther Mader, who has four world championship combined bronze medals, finished sixth behind France's Yves Dimier and Austrian Christian Mayer but was later disqualified (corrects to add the later disqualification of Mader.)
GCAT	Hundreds of Chinese children are being smuggled into Hong Kong each month and handed over to the government, apparently on rumours they will be allowed to stay in the British colony, local newspapers said on Friday. Parents from China now living legally in Hong Kong are paying up to HK$3,000 (US$390) to have their children, who do not have Hong Kong residency rights, smuggled into the territory, the South China Morning Post reported. "We can't leave my son in China while both my husband and I are here," one woman queuing at the Immigration department with her smuggled 14-year-old son told the Post. "We've heard that many parents in our hometown are finding ways to smuggle their children to Hong Kong lately...so I thought there would be an amnesty very soon," she said. But the Hong Kong government has repeatedly said all illegal immigrants, adults or children, will be sent back to China. Some 487 have been surrendered to Hong Kong authorities this month, five times the number from November, the Post said. The tide is rising. The Ming Pao Daily said the number of smuggled children under 14 years of age intercepted by police reached 330 in February, compared to an average of 26 during the first six months last year. Police intercepted a boat carrying 10 children, the youngest aged five, on Thursday, Ming Pao said. Ironically, if the smuggled children stay in hiding until July 1 when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule, they may have a better chance of remaining. Under the Basic Law, the territory's future constitution, all children of Hong Kong permanent residents will be allowed to live in the territory.
ECAT	Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Thursday that the United States was in a period of strong economic expansion aided by low inflation, which puts the nation "in a very healthy place right now." Summers spoke to reporters following release of data showing U.S. Gross Domestic Product rose 2.2 percent in the second quarter. "We're in a period of strong, stable economic expansion," Summers said, supported by a dynamic private sector and progress toward a balanced budget. Asked if there was danger of deflation, Summers said "I believe we're in a very healthy place right now." "Reductions in inflation that have been achieved are welcome," he said. He said that the current low rate of inflation strengthened consumer income and aided the competitive position of U.S. businesses. Summers added that the administration was also monitoring the economic situation in Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand.
MCAT	Argentine stocks extended their two-day rebound Wednesday on carry-over buying after last week's 5.0 percent dive, dealers said. "The market is extending its recovery, not just on short-covering but also on portfolio changes," said Adolfo Adorno at brokers Agra. "People who sold positions last week are reshuffling their investments, but the market seems to have limited upside and could already be near the top of its short-term trading range." The blue-chip MerVal index jumped 1.3 percent to 715.93, stretching the week's gains to 4.3 percent.   "The market has erased most of last week's losses thanks to this week's good U.S. consumer price data, but interest rate jitters linger and from now on prices may start to drift sideways," another trader said. He noted that while the Dow rallied sharply again Wednesday, U.S. long bond yields ticked higher. Floor volume shrank to 22.1 million pesos from 28 million Tuesday, while over-the-counter turnover swelled to 155.2 million pesos from 81.1 million Tuesday. The broad market index closed up 1.4 percent, with winners bashing losers 40 to 16 and seven issues closing flat.   Top main-tier risers were foods giant Molinos, steel company Siderca and Bansud bank, which all gained 3.1 percent, and Banco Frances, up 3.0 percent. MerVal losers were led by pulp and paper maker Celulosa, carmaker Sevel and textile and footwear firm Alpargatas, which declined 2.6 percent, 2.0 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.

GCAT	Four French climbers and hikers fell to their deaths in separate accidents at the weekend, police said on Sunday. In the Alps, an experienced 30-year-old climber fell 80 metres (260 ft) from the spectacular thorn-shaped Dibona peak in the Oisans range. Two hikers, one of them aged 72, died in falls in the Savoy region. And in the central Auvergne region, a climbing instructor fell to his death on the Puy-de-Sancy mountain. Some 50 people have died in a rash of climbing or hiking accidents in the Alps since mid-July.
CCAT	North American, English, Malaysian and New Zealand firms have signalled their interest in buying State-owned enterprise Works Corp, the Evening Post quoted market sources as saying on Tuesday. The companies include: W S Atkins, a large English engineering consultancy which also specialises in management of roads and waste water plant; Renong Corp, part of United Engineers in Malaysia ; an unknown North American firm; and a consortium of New Zealand construction companies. The government was expected to make an announcement on the future of the company this afternoon.   Works Corp, which includes Works Civil Construction and Works Consultancy, employs about 1200 staff, ranking it first equal alongside Beca Carter Hollings and Ferner in terms of size. The government has been trying to sell Works as a package, rather than in two pieces. This has complicated the sale process because most groups were interested in buying only one-half of the business, sources said. Two months ago, Downer Construction NZ bought the third tranche of Works, called Works Geothermal, for an undisclosed sum.   Another factor complicating the sale has been large contingent liabilities carried by Works, sources said. These are mainly staff redundancy agreements. "If the new owner wants to downsize, they'll have to pay out a lot," a source said. -- Wellington newsroom (64 4) 473 4746
ECAT	The Polish economy slowed slightly in February due to seasonal factors, but was growing faster than a year ago, when winter weather was much harsher than this year, the Central Statistical Office (GUS) said. "This year winter was not as harsh as last year, which had a positive effect on the economy," deputy GUS president Janusz Witkowski told a news conference on Friday. Industrial production in February eased 2.8 percent against January but was still 8.7 percent higher than in February 1996. Production in the January-February period of this year was 9.5 percent higher than in the same period last year. He said the number of jobless in February eased by some 24,000 people. The unemployment rate for February will be announced by the labour ministry on Monday. "The progress in reducing unemployment was not very impressive last month, but it is important that we did not see the usual at this time of year increase in the number of jobless," Witkowski said. The rate for January was 13.5 percent with the number of jobless at 2.34 million people. He welcomed a further slow-down in the growth of consumer and producer prices in February noting the slower rise of food prices -- long the main engine of the consumer price index. Consumer prices rose 1.1 percent in February after a 2.9 percent rise in January bringing the year-on-year index down to 17.3 percent. Producer prices rose 0.6 percent last month against 1.8 percent in January taking the year-on-year figure down to 10.5 percent. "However, the slow-down in inflation in the January- February period is still smaller than one could expect if this year's targets envisgaed by the budget are to be met," Witkowski said. Poland aims to bring down inflation to 13 percent in year-on-year terms in 1997 from 18.5 percent in 1996 and to 15.0 percent in average annual terms from 19.9 percent in 1996. -- Jan Strupczewski +48 22 653 9700
CCAT	Corporate Investments Ltd said on Wednesday it looks forward to reporting a "satisfactory" profit result for the full year. Earlier, the company reported a first half net profit of NZ$11.1 million against $10.3 million in the previous corresponding period. No dividend was declared. CIL said its profit was adversely affected by interest rates higher than last year. "However it is anticipated that in the second six months interest costs will be NZ$1.5 million lower than the first six months," the company said.   CIL said its mainstream businesses Montana (wineries) and Truck Investments performed, well raising their EBIT 11.1 percent to $16.0 million and 5.2 percent to $5.0 million respectively over the same period last year. Montana's revenue grew 10.1 percent to $92.1 million. Export sales were 29 percent greater than the same period last year and export gross margin increased 52 percent. Montana successfully raised its UK prices in October 1996 and that market continues to provide strong and increasing demand for Montana's wines.   The vineyard expansion programme continued with 111.2 hectares being planted during the period. "At this pre harvest stage the 1997 vintage looks to be high quality and of reasonable quantity. With a solid six months trading behind them Montana's management is confident of achieving their full year EBIT goals," CIL said. Truck Investments' revenue rose 10.4 percent to $56.1 million. CIL said the second six months for Truck Investments may be tougher than the first, dependent upon the prevailing level of economic activity within New Zealand.   CIL said it anticipated that during the second six months there will be a tax charge of approximately $2 million deducted from tax loss benefits carried in the group balance sheet. During the first six months capital expenditure of $4.9 million was undertaken and working capital was increased by $12.3 million. The majority of this investment was made in Montana as part of the programme to grow that company's business. --Wellington Newsroom (64 4) 4734746

CCAT	UK group Cadbury Schweppes Plc's is to market to British consumers a line in quality continental European chocolate bars made by Poulain of France. It has launched three bars from Poulain - in dark,  plain and also in vanilla-flavoured white chocolate - aimed at the serious chocolate lover and containing more cocoa solids than the traditional British bar. "Consumers have become more accustomed to Continental tastes and have consequently developed a more sophisticated palate" said Richard Hughes, Cadbury's trade marketing controller. Demand for Continental-style chocolate has risen in the last year to account for 1.7% of the UK tablet market and is expected to continue to rise as more Britons aspire to continental European tastes.
GCAT	Britain welcomed an agreement reached on Wednesday by NATO and Russia which will lay the foundation for a new relationship between the former Cold War foes. Foreign Minister Robin Cook congratulated NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov for their work in securing the pact. "I hope that it will now be endorsed by NATO members and Russia and lead to a summit in Paris on May 27 at which the text will be signed by (Russian) President Yeltsin and the heads of state and government of NATO countries and Senor Solana," Cook said in statement. Solana and Primakov announced the deal at a joint news conference in Moscow after months of negotiations. The accord is designed to ease Russia's worries about the NATO's planned expansion eastwards and includes key issues such as military problems, which had been the main obstacles to agreement. NATO had been anxious to clinch the deal before a summit in Madrid in July at which the defence alliance is expected to invite several former Soviet allies to join.
MCAT	Copper prices tumbled on Thursday, hurt by a report that more than half a million tons of the metal may be stashed in hidden stockpiles. Heating oil prices rallied as cold weather in the Midwest and on the East Coast kept stocks tight. The Knight Ridder Commodity Research Bureau index of 17 futures contracts rose 1.08 points to 243.41. The World Bureau of Metal Statistics on Wednesday estimated that nearly 600,000 metric tons of copper not previously reported may have built up in Netherlands warehouses between 1991 and 1995. The report came as traders were already eyeing warily a drop of more than 60 percent in London Metal Exchange stocks since early September to a six-year low of 109,175 tons. "There is metal disappearing off the LME and it is clearly not going into consumption. The market cannot go from showing a small surplus to major deficit in a month. Something strange is happening to LME stocks," said Peter Hollands of Bloomsbury Minerals Economics. Many, however, were sceptical about the bureau report. "I have been to European smelters who hold say 20,000 tons of stock. That takes up a tremendous amount of space, so I cannot imagine what 20 times that would take up," one European industry source said. Switching metal between the highly visible LME warehouses and secretive off-market stores may have allowed Sumitomo Corp.'s former head trader Yasuo Hamanaka to operate without discovery for years. In June Sumitomo fired Hamanaka after it alleged that he admitted running up losses now put at $2.6 billion in 10 years of unauthorised trading. Hamanaka has since been arrested and charged with fraud. "There was some hidden inventory associated with Hamanaka, and it probably was around 100,000 tons. It has now disappeared," said independent analyst Simon Hunt. Copper for December delivery fell 2.05 cents to 95.85 cents a pound at New York's Commodity Exchange. Heating oil rallied for the second straight session in New York after inventory data failed to show a significant buildup in heating oil supplies amid unseasonably cold weather in many parts of the United States. "We are in a strong buying mode during a time of a heating oil supply problem when it is a lot colder in the Midwest and East Coast," said James Cordier, a trader with Allendale Inc. December heating oil jumped 2.20 cents to 73.40 cents a gallon at the New York Mercantile Exchange. December crude oil rose 29 cents to $24.41 barrel, and December gasoline added 0.58 cent to 68.92 cents a gallon. On Wednesday, the American Petroleum Institute (API) said distillate stocks, which includes heating oil and diesel, fell 827,000 barrels for the week ended Nov. 8. Heating oil stocks grew a meagre 120,000 barrels, with growth restrained by increased demand last week in preparation for this week's cold spell in the Northeast. "Heating oil (stocks) is a little more than 14 million barrels below a year ago, and that's the key right there," said Bob Yawger, trader with E.D. & F. Man International Inc. Weather Services Corp. forecast temperatures will continue to be eight to 15 degrees below normal in the Northeast and up to 12 degrees below normal in the Midwest. Temperatures are expected to moderate to normal next week in both regions. Traders said the forecast for warmer temperatures could trigger profit-taking in the oil complex in the next two sessions.
ECAT	German industrialists on Wednesday urged Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition government to tone down a debate over tax cuts that has become the issue to fill a summer lull in news. During parliament's recess, politicians from Kohl's coalition of Christian Democrats and liberal Free Democrats (FDP), joined by the main opposition Social Democrats (SPD), have kept up a steady chorus calling for cuts in income tax. For weeks, hardly a day has passed without a leading member of the FDP restating the party's demands for a sweeping reform of the income tax system before the general election in 1998. At the same time, Kohl recently fuelled the summer debates from his Austrian vacation home by suggesting a rise in value added tax to finance a cut in income taxes. But as the sultry Rhineland summer fades and politicians gear up for their return to Bonn, Germany's main industry association took the opportunity to remind the political establishment that the issue was more than summer theatre. In a statement, Hans-Olaf Henkel, president of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), said he "appealed to the government to steer the discussion in a clear direction and quieter waters". In order to benefit industry, and lay the foundation for job creation, broad tax reform must lower the total share of taxes and levies on basic pay to 40.7 percent by the year 2000 from around 43.7 percent now, he said. It must also lower tax burdens for companies, eliminate taxes on trading capital and lend a hand to mid-sized companies, many of which are family-owned, by easing inheritance taxes, he added. At issue is the second phase of a government plan to lower tax burdens. The first step is to take place next year and will involve lowering a so-called solidarity tax, which was put in place to finance German unification. It also aims to scrap taxes on wealth, delay a rise in child benefits and change taxes on vehicles to be based on emissions instead of horsepower. The second phase will deal directly with income tax and the costs of labour but the government coalition has been divided over when and how to implement this step. Kohl's CDU and the FDP have been at odds over details of the planned tax reform and when it should take effect. The FDP wants the second phase of tax reform to take effect ahead of the next election, which must take place before the end of 1998. Kohl prefers to wait until 1999. "The dramatic situation with four million jobless demands quick action," said FDP general secretary Guido Westerwelle. But Hansgeorg Hauser, state secretary in the Finance Ministry, has rejected the FDP demand to bring forward the tax reform. "It would be impossible to carry out the necessary changes to the law so quickly," Hauser told the weekly Wirtschafts Woche business magazine. Economic experts and industry representatives say high taxes are one of the main reasons why businesses are not investing. Members of Germany's "Five Wise Men", a panel of independent economic advisers to the government, urge lower corporate taxes, with one, Rolf Peffekoven, warning: "Germany as a centre of industrial production is in danger."

CCAT	Investor Michael Blumenfeld said Thursday he sold his 300,000 shares in Sport Supply Group Inc and formed a company called NitroSports to compete with Sport Supply in the sports equipment distribution business. Blumenfeld, who founded Sport Supply, was replaced as chairman of the company last December when Emerson Radio Corp completed its acquisition of a 27 percent interest in Sport Supply and installed Geoffrey Jurick as chairman. In a statement released on NitroSports letterhead, Blumenfeld also said he remains in talks regarding efforts to acquire control of Littlefield, Adams & Co. "If a successful transaction is completed, we intend to transform LFA from its current sports imprint business to a diversified sports equipment company," Blumenfeld said. "Several conditions have been set forth which must be met to bring this matter to closure but we are prepared to work with management in any way possible to facilitate a transaction," he said. On June 5, Littlefield said it altered its talks with Blumenfeld but declined to elaborate on specifics regarding how the nature of the talks had changed. ((New York Newsdesk 212 859 1610))
GCAT	U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich admitted on Saturday he had submitted erroneous information to the House Ethics Committee, as charged by the panel, but said he had not intended to mislead it. "With great sadness, I have filed an answer which admits to that violation," Gingrich, second-in-line to succeed the president, said in a statement about filing false information. He said he regretted having "brought down on the people's house a controversy which could weaken the faith people have in their government." "In responding to complaints in this matter, I did not manage the effort intensely enough to throroughly direct or review information being submitted to the Committee on my behalf. "In my name and over my signature, inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable statements were given to (the) Committee, but I did not intend to mislead the Committee," Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, said. "I accept responsibility for this, and I deeply regret it," he added. "I did not seek personal gain, but my actions did not reflect creditably on the House of Representatives. His statement was released at the same time as the Ethics Investigative subcommittee issued a statement of alleged violations against Gingrich, who is seeking to become the first Republican to be re-elected House speaker in 68 years. At the centre of the ethics probe was the use of tax-deductible charitable contributions to a college course Gingrich taught from 1993 to 1995. Federal tax laws bar the use of tax deductible contributions to further a partisan political agenda. Recently the investigation was expanded to include whether Gingrich misled the ethics panel. House Republican leaders rallied around Gingrich with an eye to minimising any damage to his prospects for re-election as speaker when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 7, saying he had accepted full responsibility for mistakes that were made. Representative Porter Goss, the Florida Republican who heads the investigative subcommittee, said the full House Ethics panel would have to determine what punishment if any to recommend to the full House. Possible sanctions include everything from a reprimand to expulsion from the House, which is considered by experts to be out of the question.
MCAT	Shares of Nigeria's quoted banks ended buoyantly on Wednesday on increased investor interest, dealers said. The strong bank performance, coupled with a steady rise in food shares, saw the all-share index rise to 8561.40 from 8508.86 on Tuesday. Traders said the leading banks continued to attract buyers. First Bank gained 25 kobo to close at 18.75 naira. Union Bank at 15.90 naira, was also 25 kobo higher. NAL Merchant Bank the top merchant bank added 10 kobo to 6.45 naira, the same as UBA which ended at 13.60 naira. FSB International Bank rose five kobo to 3.10 naira from speculators looking for growing stocks because of its recent share split. Shares of conglomerates also firmed on improved perception, dealers said. But Wednesday's biggest movers in percentage terms included footwear company Bata, up five kobo to 1.20 naira. Stocks are allowed no more than five percent move either way daily. "Traders were reacting to Bata's declared determination to begin production of good quality shoes that would satisfy Nigerians' high taste," said one broker. Speculative buying saw Nigerian Breweries rise 50 kobo to 19.75 naira while soft drinks giant Nigerian Bottling Company shot up by 40 kobo to 51.40 naira. PZ Industries added 20 kobo to close at 26.20 naira, the same closing price for Lever Brothers which rose 30 kobo. However, John Holt fell five kobo to 9.65 naira due to a spurt of selling activities. The main losers on Wednesday were Guinness and stationery firm WTN, both 10 kobo lower at 8.40 naira and 6.35 naira, respectively. Benue Cement Company which lost ground recently rose on renewed interest. It gained 21 kobo more at 5.66 naira. There was no respite for oil shares although the fuel scarcity that caused traders to shun them had begun to ease. -- Lagos newsroom +234 1 263 03 17
CCAT	LCI International on Tuesday said it reached a definitive agreement with IXC Communications Inc to buy a position in a fiber-optic cable being built from Chicago to Los Angeles. The cost of the agreement was about $100 million, it said. Under the deal, IXC would provide LCI with 3,100 additional route miles of fiber-optic cable along its Los Angeles-Chicago route, which is due to be completed by the summer, it said. LCI said it was also seeking to expand its network by negotiating to acquire positions in other IXC fiber-optic cables. Company executives said new routes would provide LCI with additional network capacity to accommodate the planned growth and expansion over the next decade, and it would achieve significant cost savings by eliminating fiber-optic facilities now leased from other carriers. LCI is a long-distance telecommunications carrier, and Texas-based IXC Communications supplies digital transmission and long-distance services.

MCAT	Hungarian share prices closed in a bearish note on the Budapest Stock Exchange on Monday as the recently published corporate results failed to give an impetus. "Hardly any positive developments occurred today and this trend seems to continue," said Attila Berecz of Raiffeisen Securities. "Good corporate results have triggered investors mostly for sales," he said. The BUX index ended at 3,561.68 points, down 44.60. BUX index fuures closed lower for all maturities, by between 13.00 to 20.50 points. Traders said the results have encouraged mostly sales rather than purchases on the market and also investors were arranging their portfolios ahead of the end of the year on a market which was among the fastest growing bourses this year. "We are approaching the end of the year and one could have earned quite nicely on this market and shares are not undervalued any more," Berecz said. "Most movements are technical." Nevertheless, meat food processor Pick has edged up today, following the release of its January-September results, to close at 7,100 forints, up 50.

ECAT	The Reserve Bank of New Zealand said on Tuesday underlying inflation for the June 1997 quarter was 0.30 percent and 1.49 percent for the year. The central bank, which is mandated to aim for underlying inflation between 0-3 percent, had forecast a quarterly rate of 0.3 percent. Economists' consensus forecast was for 0.33 percent in the June quarter and 1.5 percent annually. Earlier, Statistics New Zealand reported CPI inflation rose 0.1 percent in the June quarter for an annual rate of 1.1 percent.   -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 473-4746
CCAT	Novell Inc and Sun Microsystems Inc said Wednesday they have entered into a strategic alliance to broaden the reach and capabilities of Sun's Java technologies to developers creating Java applications for business intranets. According to the statement, Novell will license Sun's Java WorkShop development environment, other Java technologies and WebNFS for use with its IntranetWare platform, while Sun will license Novell Directory Services (NDS) and make it available on its Solaris operating environment.

Java's platform-independent "write once, run anywhere" capability; and the ability of NDS to access, manage, and secure network information, it said. The intranet alliance includes a range of marketing and engineering activities to promote Java, the companies said.
ECAT	French consumer spending on manufactured goods fell 1.7 percent in February, giving a year-on-year fall of 2.8 percent, national statitics institute INSEE said on Wednesday. Economists said the fall was worse than expected, but was offset by a strong upwards revision to January data. INSEE said consumer spending in January, which was boosted by sales, rose 3.0 percent compared to a 1.9 percent rise initially reported. "The February fall is bigger than expected, but there is a strong revision in January. The January figures are up because of the January sales. Overall there is nothing surprising in these figures, Deutsche Bank economist Svenga Nehls said. Economists are looking closely at early data for this year to test the solidity of France's economic recovery. The government, which needs healthy growth this year to help it reduce the budget deficit ahead of European monetary union and bring down record unemployment, is expecting full year growth of at least 2.3 percent after 1.3 percent last year.
MCAT	NWE gasoline prices were boosted on Wednesday by a cocktail of bullish fundamentals at a time when demand normally drops off and the spotlight is on the heating oil market. An open arbitrage to the U.S. cemented by the sharp rally in NYMEX gasoline to contract highs on Tuesday, and the ongoing strike at three Elf refineries in France lifted barges about $4 in thin physical trading. A local refinery official also said that unions called a 24-hour strike at Royal Dutch/Shell Group's 128,000 barrel per day Berre refinery in southern France for next Monday. Eurograde barges rose to $220/$222 fob ARA with offers for Rotterdam running refinery material at $224. "We have the French situation and product can still easily move to America," said one barge trader. "It's America that is making us move up." Traders waited for direction from the U.S. and what impact if any recent inventory data would have on NYMEX gasoline, which fell slightly in ACCESS trading. American Petroleum Institute said gasoline stocks rose 1.9 million barrels, above market expectations, to 188.6 million. Stocks were still 6.9 million below a year ago. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that U.S. gasoline supplies jumped 3.2 million barrels. Traders said Elf was rumoured to have been a buyer in the physical market this week as the strike has cut 100,000 bpd of gasoline production. "They have bought a significant quantity," from both the U.K. and the rest of Europe, said one trader. "The arb is still open and it looks pretty well supported...Crude does not look vulnerable either and it has the potential to wind up," he said. Traders said a 30,000 to 35,000 tonne cargo was sold late Tuesday out of Europe to the U.S. for loading December 15-20, but this could not be confirmed. Separately, Texaco fixed the Libertad for 36,000 tonnes of gasoline for loading December 3 out of Pembroke, England, for the U.S. Atlantic Coast, according to shipping sources. Unions and management of Elf are set to meet on Thursday and France's largest trade union had said on Tuesday that disruption by oilworkers would soon spread to Shell and Esso plants. The strike has crippled a quarter of French capacity and three-quarters of Elf's European refining network. France consumes about 350,000 bpd of gasoline. -- John Hanley, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8185
ECAT	Swiss National Bank Chairman Hans Meyer said that the Swiss economy, which is expected to grow 0.5 percent in 1997, was not yet recovering fast enought to justify changes in monetary policy. "The economic recovery is not far enough now to make an adjustment of monetary policy urgent. There are still some risks," Meyer said in the text of a speech to be delivered at the central bank's summer news conference. Meyer said the SNB had repeatedly stated it would only consider tightening when there were clear signs an economic recovery was under way.   Despite recent overshooting of the SNB's monetary base versus the target for growth of roughly one percent per year, Meyer said current policy did not pose a great threat to price stability. "This overshooting is justified by the current economic situation," Meyer said. He also said that broader monetary aggregates were showing less signs of serious expansion and that their growth was expected to slow in coming months. "Our monetary policy thus poses no direct inflationary threat. In spite of that, we will remain vigilant," he said. -- Zurich newsroom +41 1 631 7340
MCAT	The New Zealand dollar was lower in late Thursday afternoon trade before a scheduled news conference by Treasurer Winston Peters at 5 p.m. (0400 GMT). By 4.45 p.m. (0345 GMT) the Kiwi was at US$0.7061/68 and at 67.33 on the Trade-Weighted Index from 0.7068/75, 67.50 at the opening. The Kiwi had spent most of the day in a tight range and flows were light.   Peters' conference is expected to cover issues raised by the Treasury's post-election briefing paper, which warned the incoming coalition about the adverse effects of additional fiscal stimulus. "The news conference at 5 p.m. from Winston has put a soft note underneath it toward the end of the day," said one dealer. Peters has often advocated a lower New Zealand dollar. "But there were no real significant flows. Trade has been very light today," he said. Further weakness was expected, as had been the trend over the last few days.   "It may drift lower and find some real support, probably back to that 0.7030-40 area," he said. Expected overnight range US$0.7050-75. -- Wellington Newsroom (64-4-4734746)
GCAT	Cash from assets confiscated from drug traffickers will be used for the first time by an international organisation to help fight the illicit trade in narcotics, the United Nations said on Tuesday. Luxembourg has become the first country to contribute funds derived from drug dealers' assets to the U.N.'s Vienna-based drug control agency. The money will be used by the United Nations International Drugs Control Programme to help train drug control officials, including police, prosecutors and customs officers, in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru, the U.N. said. The agency's executive director Giorgio Giacomelli said Luxembourg's contribution marked the first time a country had transferred funds to an international body to fight drug trafficking. Luxembourg's provision of $200,000, although modest, was considered an important step in attempts to persuade other nations to follow suit. The idea of using seized assets was enshrined in a 1988 international convention against illicit traffic in drugs. "This is a radical breakthrough in the convention. The climate was such in 1988 that many thought that such transfers were just pie in the sky," U.N. spokeswoman Nancy Borman told Reuters. "It makes sense to have the fund and cross-border cooperation...drugs can come from one country, traffickers from another and the proceeds from drugs laundered in yet another country," she added. Funds set up in several countries containing cash from drugs proceeds or from the sale of seized property bought with drugs money are estimated to total hundreds of millions of dollars. The U.N. drugs body said it was encouraged by a new commitment among many states to legislate against money laundering, cutting off a major lifeline for traffickers. Broad new anti-money laundering laws have recently been adopted in such countries as Australia, the United States, Britain, Germany, Canada and Japan. South Africa's ruling African National Congress said on Monday parliament would soon study new legislation against money laundering that puts the onus on banks and other institutions to report suspicious transactions. Ironically, Austria, the home of the drugs agency and other U.N. organisations, has come under fire this year from the United States, which said Vienna condoned a secretive banking system that made the Alpine republic a harbour for dirty money. Washington last year ranked Austria alongside Colombia, Venezuela and Thailand in a league table of countries that tolerate money laundering. The European Commission has ordered Vienna to start taking steps to outlaw anonymous bank accounts, in which huge amounts of dirty money, in particular from Eastern Europe, are believed to be deposited. Austria, the only EU country which permits nameless accounts, has ignored the Commission's demands, arguing that the accounts were part of tradition and a symbol of personal liberty.
GCAT	The opposition Sudan Alliance Forces (SAF) said on Wednesday its soldiers killed four Sudanese government troops near Kassala in eastern Sudan last week. Bakheet Ali Al-Hassan, the SAF representative in Eritrea, said his forces attacked a military car close to the military camp of Al-Greda on September 19, killing four soldiers. Government soldiers retaliated with a raid on a rebel camp near Abu Gamul two days later. There were no casualties. Eritrea supports Sudanese groups fighting to oust the Islamist government in Khartoum which it says is destabilising the region. The SAF, formed in 1994, has been the most active rebel group in eastern Sudan in the last few months and says it has camps on both sides of the Eritrea-Sudan border.
ECAT	Australia's underlying budget deficit for the first four months of fiscal 1996/97 was A$10.275 billion, compared with A$7.291 billion a year earlier, Finance Minister John Fahey said on Friday. The headline balance was a deficit of A$6.461 billion for the same period, compared with a A$4.374 billion deficit a year earlier, Fahey said in a statement. The underlying measure excludes the proceeds from asset sales and state debt repayments to the federal government.   The month of October alone produced an underlying deficit of A$4.410 billion, compared with A$1.758 billion in October 1995. The monthly headline deficit was A$4.211 billion, up from A$1.805 billion. Revenue growth so far this fiscal year was minus 1.7 percent, compared with the budget's assumption of plus 7.0 percent. Government spending, meanwhile, is running more strongly than budgetted. Growth to date is 3.6 percent, compared with the budget's assumption of 2.4 percent.   "The growth in outlays compared to 1995/96 mainly reflects higher outlays on age pensions, sole parent pensions, family payments, an increase in medical benefits and lower state debt repayments," Fahey said in a statement. The fall in revenue was mainly due to declines in areas of company and superannuation tax collections, he said. The monthly figures are highly seasonal and cannot be extrapolated to estimate a final outcome for 1996/97. -- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730
ECAT	The Indian government on Tuesday forecast industrial growth of about 10 percent for 1996/97 (April-March) compared to 11.7 percent in 1995/96. "A better agricultural performance in the second half of the year is likely to result in increased demand that augurs well for the industry," it said in the annual Economic Survey. The index of industrial production grew by 9.8 percent between April and October 1996 compared to 11.7 in the same period a year earlier. The government has taken several policy measures, including the lowering of interest rates and the increase in availability of bank funds, to reverse a slowdown in industrial growth, the survey said. "Given these trends, the current year is expected to end up with an industrial growth rate of around 10 percent," it said. --New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024

"The second meeting of the joint committee on cooperation between our countries underscores the willingess of Morocco and Iran to make up for lost time and strengthen bilateral relations and expand our sturdy cooperation to all fields," said Morocco's External Trade Minister Mohamed Alami. Iran's Commerce Minister Yahya Al-Eshaq echoed him, saying "the participation of several experts and senior officials in the Iranian delegation mirrors Iran's particular interest in boosting ties with Morocco". Alami and Al-Eshaq were quoted by MAP as addressing a joint committee meeting in Rabat to spur bilateral cooperation.

GCAT	A Texas family trying to get back a Russian piano factory lost in the 1917 Bolshevik revolution has asked a U.S. judge to seize the priceless Romanov jewelry collection currently on display here. Attorney Lee Magness, also a plaintiff, said he hoped to use the Romanov jewels to force the Russian government to hand over the factory. "There is a deep motivation to get things straight again," Magness told Reuters. A hearing seeking a temporary restraining order to keep the jewels in Houston is set for Friday before U.S. District Judge David Hittner. The Houston exhibit, which has drawn long lines of visitors, opened on May 11 and is set to end on July 27. The jewels are in the United States on a one-year tour, but their next destination was not yet known. Magness said the piano factory, located in St. Petersburg and owned by his grandfather Carl Schroder, turned out some of the finest pianos in the world and included many of Europe's royals among its customers. But Schroder lost the factory after the Bolshevik revolution and fled Russia. Two of his daughters, Nina and Agnes, ended up in Texas where they have lived for many years. Magness, who is the son of Nina Schroder Magness, said the family went back to St. Petersburg in 1994 to reclaim the property, now the Red October Piano Factory, and were assured by the post-Communist government that it would be returned to them. But later, he said, the Russian Ministry of Culture declared the factory a national treasury to be kept by the government. The lawsuit also asks that revenues from the Romanov exhibition be frozen until the matter is settled. Magness said his mother is living on his father's military pension and his aunt is a schoolteacher nearing retirement. The jewels and art objects in the collection belonged to the Romanov dynasty that ruled Russia for three centuries. In April the collection was held in a van parked on a Washington, D.C., street for several days because of Russian demands for a bigger cut of the exhibition revenues.
ECAT	Britain's trade deficit with the rest of the world widened in February, official figures showed on Thursday, as overseas demand for goods started to dry up in the face of the strong pound. The Office for National Statistics said the global trade gap widened to 758 million pounds ($1.2 billion) in February as export volumes slipped by 1.4 percent. January's trade gap was revised down to 535 million pounds from 641 million at the first estimate. More up-to-date partial data covering trade with countries outside the European Union indicated the export picture deteriorated further in March. The non-EU deficit widened to 606 million pounds in March from 437 million in February. Export volumes tumbled by 4.0 percent. Economists said the figures were the first official data to show clearly that exporters are struggling as the strong pound makes British goods more expensive abroad. "There has been quite a big drop in exports in February and March. We are now seeing the pound's rally having a big impact," said David Coleman, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy. The figures added weight to recent business surveys suggesting export orders were in decline. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has been reporting falling demand for exports for several months. On Wednesday it said that while the manufacturing sector grew in April, export orders registered their sharpest decline in April since late 1993. Despite the pound's eight-month rally -- it has appreciated by around 16 percent on a trade-weighted basis in that time -- official figures have until now not been affected. Analysts said it was particularly worrying that business with countries outside Europe was also deteriorating. "A lot of attention has been given to sterling's rally against European currencies and the impact on exports, but these data show we are losing ground with trading partners outside Europe and that is a concern," said Coleman. With domestic demand already robust and set to strengthen even further, the trade balance is likely to worsen this year. "We are heading for a deterioration, caused by import growth buoyed by consumer spending at home and weak exports because of continued competitive problems," said Francesca Massone, analyst at Goldman Sachs. But she said there was little danger of a crisis. "The rise in sterling should correct itself soon and tighter monetary policy after the election will slow consumer spending and demand for imports." Most economists expect interest rates to rise by either a quarter or half a point from 6.0 percent after the May 1 election. ($ = 0.615 British Pounds)

MCAT	Millfeed markets were quiet Thursday and price declines occurred in areas where flour mill runs increased, dealers said. Flour production increased slightly this week in the Kansas City and interior Kansas markets. Kansas City prices were unchanged to up $1 per ton at $77 to $78 after dropping $3 to $6 per ton Wednesday. Interior Kansas/Oklahoma values were down $1.00 to unchanged at $81 bid and $86 offered. Texas and North Carolina dealers reported buyer interest was primarily for next week delivery with very little demand for May or summertime positions.   Buffalo values were unchanged at $86 offered for prompt shipment, but dealers said prices should drop next week. "I think we are in for a bit of a decline next week. Other markets around us continue to weaken," said a Buffalo dealer. Specifically, Ohio and Pennsylvania millfeed prices were sliding. Ohio values declined steadily this week, he said. Pennsylvania values were lower, pressured by competition from Carolina millfeeds being shipped into Virginia, normally a Pennsylvania market, he said. ((Chicago newsdesk 312-408-8720))
GCAT	China launched the contest to pick Hong Kong's future leader on Friday, hailing the event as the birth of "real democracy" in the British-ruled territory which is set to revert to Beijing's control next year. But pro-democracy protesters disagreed -- they stormed into the building where Hong Kong's rich and mighty had gathered to vote, and, waving imitation black coffins, they denounced the exercise as the death of freedom. Only 400 of Hong Kong's 6.3 million people are participating in the voting, having joined a special Selection Committee set up under China's close supervision. Shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa and his principal rival, former Chief Justice Ti Liang Yang both scored more than the minimum of 50 votes required to reach the next leg of the contest to select the first post-colonial Chief Executive. Tung took a commanding lead with 206 votes. Also through to round two is businessman Peter Woo, but five contenders including former appeals court judge Simon Li fell out of the race. The run-off will be on December 11. The gathering of the Selection Committee, inaugurated by China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who was visiting the territory for the first time, was marred by scuffles when pro-democracy activists clashed with police. A dozen demonstrators scrambled into the plush Hong Kong Convention Centre in an unsuccessful bid to disrupt the historic meeting. Police chased protesters up six floors of escalators before they were rounded up and detained. Outside, a police officer received a bloody nose and three more demonstrators were carted away in scuffles between about 40 activists and 100 police. In his inauguration speech Qian declared the selection process as the dawn of genuine democracy in Hong Kong. "For Hong Kong's people to elect their own chief executive, that is something unprecedented in Hong Kong's history," he said. "For some 150 years Britain has appointed 20 or so Hong Kong governors, and when were the views of Hong Kong people ever consulted?" Qian asked the assembled caucus. "The establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is the start of real democracy in Hong Kong, and not the end of democracy in Hong Kong," he said. Hong Kong reverts to China at midnight next June 30. Tung, 59, Yang, 67, and Woo, 50, are now the only hopefuls left in the race, and Qian was at pains to stress that despite claims by critics that the winner had been chosen in advance by China's communist rulers, the result was not preordained. The democracy activists brandished posters of jailed Chinese dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng and banners condemning China's plan to replace Hong Kong's elected legislature. "Free Wang Dan, release Wei Jingsheng, oppose the provisional legislature", they shouted through loudhailers. The democracy lobby brands the leadership race undemocratic and has campaigned against the provisional legislature. "The provisional legislature is a great step backwards for democracy," one protest banner said on Friday. British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind warned China on Thursday its plans for a provisional legislature risked creating "confusion and uncertainty" in Hong Kong. "China would have to explain to Hong Kong and the world why they had chosen to replace a body for which more than a million Hong Kong people voted by one chosen by a handpicked electorate of only 400," he told a parliamentary debate in London.
CCAT	British household products group Reckitt and Colman Plc expects to see similar growth rates in sales and earnings in 1997, said chief executive Vernon Sankey. "We expect to get similar types of growth rates in both sales and earnings in the current year," said Sankey in an interview. Earlier the company reported an 11 percent rise in 1996 pretax profits to 316.5 million, right in the middle of brokers forecast range.   "Mainland Europe has been relatively flat for most of 1996 and I think it's too early to say Europe is turning around. There are some reasonable signs. France and Germany are still very tough," said Sankey. The strategy is working, he said, which remains to focus on number one and number two brands with global potential, use the group's wide geographic base and expand in developing markets. About one third of Reckitt's business comes from North America, one third in Europe, a third from the the rest of the world. Some 26 percent of business comes from developing markets of Africa, Asia and Latin America. If sterling remains at its current high levels on foreign exchange markets it would hit Reckitt by some 20 million on translation next year, he said. Sankey dismissed speculation that Unilever Plc would bid for Reckitt as just rumour, saying the company has not been approached by Unilever. "It's a rumour and we have had rumours for years. We get rumours everyday, now quite frankly that is it," said Sankey. Reckitt and Colman shares were off 4-1/2p at 782p in early trade. -- London newsroom + 44 171 542 6437
CCAT	Asian Terminals Inc said on Wednesday it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to take a 60 percent stake in Aries Arrastre Services Inc (AASI). ATI said this would enable it to participate in the potentially lucrative port of Batangas. AASI has a contract with the government's Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) to provide cargo handling services at the port of the province of Batangas. The contract runs up to January 16, 2002. Batangas is located about 90 km south of Manila. Under the MOU, ATI will infuse an undisclosed amount of capital in AASI to give it a 60 percent stake in the increased capital of AASI. The agreement between the two firms, however, will require the approval of the PPA. ATI is the sole container terminal operator for the South Harbour in Manila. It is also the sole multi-cargo operator for the port of Manila. -- Manila newsroom 63 2 841-8937 fax 8176267
MCAT	Slovak leading shares firmed in quiet trading on the Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) on Tuesday, pushing the 16-share SAX index up 0.26 points to 169.14. Oil refinery Slovnaft, the most heavily- capitalised issue, closed up four crowns at 860, while the steel maker VSZ increased by 10 crowns to 650. VSZ traded 21,534 shares in continuous trading, reporting the biggest Tuesday's volume on the BSE floor, but brokers said they did not think the issue's success was the start of a trend toward increased liquidity. "The bourse remains illiquid, despite the promising result (of VSZ)," Libor Briska of Creditanstalt said. "I don't think there is much room for further falling of the index. Some new impulses, for example impressive company results, would now definitely boost liquidity. The problem is that no such impulses are on the horizon at the moment," he added. Overall volume increased to 1,014,702 shares, from 522,079 shares traded on Monday, while turnover climbed to 868.87 million crowns, from 254.13 million. Both volume and turnover were boosted by direct trades.
CCAT	Japan Energy Corp  5014 T is planning to start retail sales of kerosene at convenience stores at the end of 1997, a Japanese newspaper said on Tuesday.

The Japanese daily also reported this is the first such plan within the oil industry. Japan Energy officials did not confirm the report.
GCAT	The top reporter on Ukraine's mass-circulation Kievskiye Vedomosti newspaper has been found dead in suspicious circumstances, one of the daily paper's editors said on Friday. "Our reporter Petro Shevchenko was found hanged in a remote part of Kiev last night," Serhiy Rakhmanin, Vedomosti's deputy editor, told Reuters. Rakhmanin said there was no clear sign of violence against the reporter but added: "Nothing is clear at the moment." Shevchenko had been reporting from the eastern industrial city of Lugansk on the Russian border and recently published several pieces on a conflict between the local mayor and the Ukrainian Security Services. The UNIAN news agency, reporting on Shevchenko's death, said he had recently "voiced concern about his situation". "We will insist that the investigation should take into account the possibility of a political explanation for the incident," Rakhmanin said. "We will also demand a criminal case be opened and that  a suicide scenario is not just assumed," he added. Last week Iryna Pohorelova, a leading political commentator and journalist for a Ukrainian analytical agency, was beaten and robbed by unknown assailants near her Kiev appartment. No official data have been gathered on violence against journalists, but independent surveys quote 15 percent of Ukrainian journalists as saying they have feared for their lives after publishing political stories. They also say about 80 percent of journalists in the former Soviet republic feel there is political censorship in Ukraine.

ECAT	Kuwait's report this week of a provisional 16.8 percent jump in 1996 gross domestic product has surprised some economists, who said on Wednesday that the oil GDP component for the previous year was probably undervalued. Estimates by experts put 1996 GDP at around 9.23 billion dinars ($30.5 billion) and possibly more than 8.3 billion dinars for 1995 compared with official figures of 9.277 billion last year and 7.942 billion the year before that. "The official figures say oil GDP grew by 31.6 percent in 1996 but the average barrel price for Kuwaiti crudes rose by say 16 percent last year and we know they were not cheating (on OPEC oil production quota)", said a leading analyst. Kuwait's two million barrel per day quota was unchanged in 1996 and experts estimate an average production of 2.03 million bpd over the past two years. "There are three options. They cheated and they did not. They overvalued oil prices for 1996 and they have no reason to do so. Or, which is probably what happened, they calculated 1995 at much lower oil prices," Kuwaiti economist Jassem al-Saddoun told Reuters. Kuwait calculates oil revenue in the budget at a conservative $13 a barrel. According to the official figures released on Monday revenue from crude oil and natural gas reached 4.127 billion dinars in 1996 from 3.137 billion in 1995. Economists said the implied barrel price in the official GDP figure for 1995 was way below the actual $15.9 average for that year but the 1996 average for Kuwaiti crudes was close to the actual $18.4 a barrel. "One problem is that the 1995 (official) figures are not revised yet. I think an upward revision for 1995 and a slight downward one for 1996 is needed, pushing (total) GDP growth for last year down towards 11 or so percent and up for 1995 to 13 percent from under eight," one economist said. These calculations assume that official figures for other sectors are accurate but one economist also found difficulty reconciling petroleum refining figures. "The implied margins are very high. They are way above actual 1996 prices when the margins dropped." The refining industry's contribution to GDP rose to 716.8 million dinars in 1996 from 580.6 million in 1995, the official figures showed. Kuwait last year raised domestic refining to an average 850,00 bpd from 800,000 bpd in 1995. In late 1996 it reached the current 895,000 bpd average. -- Kuwait Newsroom, +965 240 8945

ECAT	Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, stressing the need to reverse an economic slump, said on Monday he expected Russia to win up to $20 billion in foreign investment by the year 2000, Itar-Tass news agency said. The figure included loans from the World Bank and foreign governments, direct investment and oil industry investments, Chernomyrdin told a foreign investment conference. It quoted him as saying the most pressing economic goal for Russia was to achieve economic growth this year. Gross domestic product shrank six percent in 1996. Interfax news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying foreign investment flows into Russia had begun to improve after President Boris Yeltsin was re-elected in July 1996. Chernomyrdin said Russia would continue with reforms such as decreasing taxes to improve the investment climate. "My position here is clear -- next year's budget will not be considered or accepted without changes to the tax system and a decrease in the tax burden for the real sector," he said. A major overhaul of Russia's tax system is under review by the Russian Duma lower house of parliament, which on Friday passed the 1997 budget in a fourth and final reading. Chernomyrdin also said the government would begin industrial reform to improve management and bring accounting standards to world levels. Russian Economy Ministry data showed that foreign investment over the first nine months of 1996 was $4.5 billion, almost three times 1995 levels, Interfax said. Economy Minister Yevgeny Yasin said last week 1997 foreign investment, not including flows to Treasury bills, would be $4-5 billion and Interfax quoted a ministry official as saying total foreign investment would be about $6-7 billion. --Peter Henderson, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520
ECAT	French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn's predictions of a deficit well above 3.0 percent of GDP in 1997 are based on expectations of a shortfall in tax revenue and other state income and a fall in the unemployment benefit fund's surplus, minutes of a Wednesday meeting show. The minutes of Strauss-Kahn's closed-door address to the National Assmebly's finance committee spell out the factors, many of which have already been described by the new left-wing government and others. The minutes report him as saying that a 0.42 percent fall in contributions to the unemployment benefit fund UNEDIC would wipe out a 10-billion-franc UNEDIC surplus which had been included in the previous government's 1997 budget and deficit calculations. Strauss-Kahn also said that the 1997 budget had predicted a 3.3 percent rise in welfare contributions, which was more than could be counted on, and that revenues could fall six or seven billion francs short of expectations. The previous centre-right government forecast a social security deficit of 30 billion in 1997 in its initial budget law but later acknowledged that the deficit could come in above 35 billion. Strauss-Kahn was reported as telling the committee that the previous centre-right government's forecasts for value-added tax revenues had been overly optimistic, even taking account of the 1997 budget's predictions on economic growth -- a rise of 2.3 percent in GDP in 1997. The minutes also reported him as saying some spending plans appeared to have been underestimated or insuffiicently provisioned. This belief would have to await the audit on public finances, due on July 21, for confirmation. The previous government had insisted right up to the June 1 election when it lost power that it was on course to meet its target of reducing the deficit to 3.0 percent of GDP. Strauss-Kahn told reporters these factors undermined the logic of a repeat this year of the public deficit declines of previous years, from 5.6 percent of GDP in 1993 to 4.8 percent in 1994 and to 4.2 percent in 1996. The previous government had been counting on a central government deficit of 3.4 percent, a social security deficit representing about 0.3 percentage points and a local government surplus worth 0.2 percentage points -- giving a net public deficit of 3.5 percent -- he was reported as saying. The rest would have been compensated by the transfer of pension funds from France Telecom which has now been completed and would bring the public deficit to around 3.0 percent of GDP. The minutes said Strauss-Kahn told the committee that despite the France Telecom money -- 37.5 billion francs -- the public deficit was unlikely to match the previous government's predictions due to the tax and social security contribution shortfalls, the fall in the unemployment fund surplus and the possible failure on spending control. The minutes said Strauss-Kahn told the committee that if the audit of finances showed "massive slippage", the government would ensure that the deficit did not worsen but at the same time not impose an austerity plan which would weigh again on households. The UNEDIC fund said on Wednesday that it expected its cumulative surplus to come in at 996 million francs in 1997, down sharply from the 10.3 billion surplus at the end of 1996. -- Brian Love, Paris Newsroom +33 1 4221 5452

GCAT	Holders New Zealand tightened their grip on the Tri-Nations championship with an emphatic 33-18 win against Australia in front of a record 90,000 fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday. Veteran centre Frank Bunce, the two-try hero of the All Blacks' stirring 35-32 defeat of South Africa in the series opener last weekend, opened the scoring with a try after 10 minutes. Winger Jeff Wilson added a second try two minutes later when he beat the defence to a kick ahead by scrum-half Justin Marshall before diving over in the corner. Fullback Christian Cullen confirmed New Zealand's all-round superiority with a third try after halftime before the Wallabies rallied against their tiring opponents with late tries from scrum-half George Gregan and centre Jason Little. Fly-half Carlos Spencer converted all three All Black tries and added four penalties in a perfect kicking display. Wallaby full-back Matt Burke replied with two first half penalties as the home side trailed 23-6 at the interval. New Zealand lead the southern hemisphere competition with nine points from two games, eight points clear of South Africa.
GCAT	A Russian cargo craft docked with the Mir space station on Friday, bringing much-needed supplies to the cosmonauts aboard the craft. A mission control spokesman said the freighter docked with Mir at 4.01 a.m. (0101 GMT). "The docking has passed successfully in automatic mode. The Mir crew plans to open the door at 5.33 a.m (0233 GMT)," the spokesman told Reuters.   Speaking by telephone from the control centre, located in Kaliningrad near Moscow, the spokesman said the Mir crew -- cosmonauts Valery Korzun and Alexander Koleri and U.S. astronaut John Blaha -- woke up at about 1 a.m.. They will begin unloading the cargo later in the the day. The Progress M-33 cargo craft was launched on Tuesday from Baikonur cosmodromme in Kazakhstan. It carried 2.4 tonnes of food, water, fuel and equipment, including tanks and pumps to relieve one of the crew's most pressing problems -- damaged toilets on the 10-year-old space station. The craft is also carrying Christmas and New Year gifts from the crew's families. Blaha and his two Russian colleagues have been on Mir station since September 19. This supply mission has been delayed for over a month, mainly due to financial problems which held up production of the Soyuz-U booster rocket.
ECAT	The Hong Kong government said on Friday it had cut its forecast of full-year gross domestic product (GDP) growth to 4.7 percent from its March estimate of 5.0 percent, and its forecast of full-year consumer price inflation to 6.8 percent from 7.5 percent.   The government also said in a statement GDP grew a preliminary estimate of slightly over four percent in the second quarter of 1996 against 3.1 percent in the first three months of the year. Hong Kong's GDP grew 4.6 percent in 1995, while inflation that year stood at 8.7 percent. "The downward adjustmnent in the forecast GDP growth rate for the year mainly reflects the further slowdown in export growth in the first half of 1996," a government statement said. The slowdown was more abrupt than initially expected and led directly to weaker overall economic growth in the first half, it said. "Preliminary indications are that the GDP growth rate rebounded in the second quarter. It is forecast to pick up further in the next two quarters," the government said. The government said there was scope for a further downward adjustment in the inflation forecast later in the year. -- Hong Kong News Room (852) 2843 6441

GCAT	Ukrainian ultra-nationalists, incensed by the unveiling of a new bust of Soviet founding father Vladimir Lenin, have threatened to retaliate by putting up a sculpture of their own -- of Adolf Hitler. Hitler and Lenin had performed "similar services" to the people of Ukraine, the small political party "State Independence of Ukraine" said in a faxed statement on Wednesday. About eight million people are estimated to have been killed when Hitler's forces overran Ukraine during World War Two. But many millions more were assassinated or starved to death at the hands of Josef Stalin, Lenin's successor. A mayor in the western town of Bilhorod-Dnistrovsky had paid for the new bust of Lenin -- "on whose conscience lie millions of murdered and tortured Ukrainians", the statement said. The nationalists said President Leonid Kuchma should order the destruction this year of thousands of Lenin monuments still standing since Ukraine won independence from Moscow in 1991. Otherwise, they would put up a bust of Hitler next year. "A decision by President Kuchma to take down all remaining Lenin statues and other symbols of the Russian occupying powers could avert such an international scandal," the statement said. Communists, many older people and traditionalists are very reluctant to part with the symbols of their Soviet past. When the mayor of the Black Sea port of Odessa ordered the removal of all Lenin statues earlier this year, some residents mounted a round-the-clock guard to stop him.
MCAT	The Zimbabwe dollar closed little changed from Tuesday's levels against the key U.S. dollar on Wednesday but dealers said import pressure still lurked in the background with room for a further depreciation. "It was a rather quiet day today but there's still fundamentally a shortage (of foreign currency) in the market," commented one dealer. "I saw one bank that was really short bidding as high as 11.6300 for U.S. dollars," he added. He and other dealers said they had not seen any evidence of intervention from the central Reserve Bank to prop up the local currency during the day. "If the central bank is doing anything then it's very little...they are saying the market should correct itself," one said. The dealers say it is up to the central bank to bring back stability to the local currency whose free-fall, triggered off last Wednesday by a large import payment, was worsened by central bank governor Leonard Tsumba's statement on Friday that the unit was overvalued. The Zimbabwe dollar ended the day at 11.5500/6500 on the U.S. dollar, little-changed from 11.5500/7500 the previous day, but was quoted easier on sterling at 18.8700/19.0450 compared to 18.7600/19.1100. It was however quoted firmer on the mark at 6.2700/3260 against 6.3100/4200 but was down at 2.5475/5505 from 2.5200/5600 against South Africa's rand. --Stella Mapenzauswa, Harare Newsroom: +263-4 72 52 27/8/9--
GCAT	Daniel Komen won a demanding 5,000 metres at Kenya's national trials for the world championships on Saturday, then declared his prize would be a victory over Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie. While Komen triumphed over a world-class field, a number of top performers including Olympic 3,000 metres steeplechase champion Josephat Keter were well beaten in their specialities. Double 5,000 metres world champion Ishmael Kirui was the first casualty, clocking 13:46.0 for sixth place in the event. Kenyan selectors delayed naming the team for the world championships in Athens in August until July 16 when top athletes will have completed their Grand Prix assignments. Under current Kenya Amateur Athletic Association rules, the first two finishers automatically qualify. The third place will be based on training. Senior sports sources said the selectors were attempting to avoid the type of error that led to Komen's absence from the Atlanta Olympics. At the time, Komen had failed to come through at the Kenyan trials but had a successful Grand Prix run. "I will meet with Gebrselassie, then we shall see who is who. I am confident that I shall win," Komen said after returning 13 minutes 23.8 seconds, beating Tom Nyariki, who clocked 13:25.1, and Paul Bitok, who was timed at 13:27.0. World 3,000 metres steeplechase champion and record holder Moses Kiptanui confirmed he was returning to his winning ways after claiming his speciality in 8:13.0. "I am definitely going for my fourth world title and hope to hang on until the 2000 Olympics, then I (will) retire," Kiptanui said. "Last year I felt stronger than now but lost at the Olympics because of illness. I am okay now." Kiptanui eased to the front from the start and maintained his lead until midway when Bernard Barmasai and Patrick Sang briefly went ahead. But with two laps to go, Kiptanui, showing no sign of stress, regained his lead and won easily. In the 800 metres, Olympic bronze medalist Fredrick Onyancha also fell by the wayside, in seventh place. Commonwealth champion Patrick Konchellah, making a comeback after an accident nearly ruined his career in 1995, won in 1:46.2 ahead of Benson Koech, who posted 1:46.03, and David Kiptoo, who recorded 1:46.4. Big names to fall in the 1,500 metres included Barcelona Olympics 800 metres champion William Tanui, who was in fourth place and Martin Keino, son of legendary Kipchoge Keino, who finished in a poor sixth place in 3:40.5.

CCAT	Specialty chemicals group Laporte PLc signalled on Monday that it did not intend to rush into acquisitions, despite having completely cleared its debts over the past year. In an interview with Reuters following publication of 1996 results, chief executive Jim Leng said the company had ended 1996 with net cash of 13 million stg on its balance sheet compared with net debt of 180 million stg a year earlier. "It is not burning a hole in our pocket. We have got a business which is growing and we will carefully and analytically decide what we are going to do," Leng said.   The company sold most of its European adhesives operations in December for 110 million stg and aims to move into higher margin businesses such as electronic chemicals. Leng said Laporte intended to take positions in "growth sectors," with international exposure and high barriers to entry. Leng told Reuters that the group had received "some initial expressions of interest" in the sale of its remaining U.S. and Italian adhesives operations, but added "it is not likely to be soon." He declined to be drawn on the likely price of the North American operations, which some analysts say could fetch around 75 million stg, equivalent to 1997's estimated sales.   Leng said the company was on target to achieve annual cost savings of 10 million stg by the end of 1997 as a result of a major shake-up of its operations, which saw 20 percent of the group's business and 34 percent of its operating units sold last year. "It has been a good all round performance.. every business division made positive cash flow contributions," Leng said, adding "there are some that we can improve further." Leng, who took over the the helm in October 1995 and was forced to issue a profits warning only weeks later, reiterated tough profit margin goals for the group. Margins improved to 12.9 percent overall in 1996 from 11.8 percent in 1995. "Our target is to get closer to 15 percent and we made some good progrss on that," Leng said, adding that he wanted to reach a position where "no business has less than 10 percent with the group at an average of 15 percent." "We won't do that overnight and we won't get there this year," he added. Leng expects raw material prices to be "pretty stable" this year, but said sterling's strength "will dilute our progress." "If fourth-quarter rates applied all year it would affect profits and sales by 50 million and five million pounds respectively," he said. --Jonathan Birt London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717
MCAT	Wholesale electricity prices in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) eased slightly Tuesday following lower spot natural gas prices, industry sources said. Spot Texas gas was said to have fallen about 20 cents to near $3.25 per million British thermal units on Tuesday. "Things did ease a bit today, although we saw some higher prices in the morning," said one ERCOT power trader. ERCOT firm, peak power for Wednesday delivery was pegged lower at $29.00-31.00 from $30.00-32.00 on Monday, the brokers and marketers said. One source reported trading ERCOT non-firm peak power for Wednesday delivery at $28.00, although the trade was not confirmed. Firm off-peak ERCOT power transactions were notionally pegged lower at $15.00-17.00 from $16.00-18.00 on Monday, the sources said, although off-peak trade was reported to be thin. ERCOT January/February peak power prices were said to have continued to ease to $29.75-30.25 from $30.00-30.50 on Monday, the sources said. --Chris Reese, New York Power Desk +1 212 859 1627

ECAT	President Bill Clinton said in a statement on Wednesday that the first-quarter U.S. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) report showed strong economic growth with moderate inflation. "Today we have received positive news about the nation's economy -- more strong growth with moderate inflation," Clinton said in a statement, adding that it was "imperative that we pass a bipartisan balanced budget agreement to continue this solid economic progress."   U.S. economic growth swept ahead at its fastest pace in more than nine years during the first quarter this year, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday, with GDP expanding at a surprising 5.6 percent annual rate. That was a strong pickup from a 3.8 percent rate of growth in last year's final quarter. Clinton attributed the strong growth in part to the fiscal tightening that his administration has put in place since coming into office in 1993. "Our sound fiscal policies, together with the hard work of the American people, have sparked a remarkable period of economic expansion and job creation," he said. "While it is still too early to know for certain, our economic policies and this year's healthy growth may help us cut the deficit for the fifth straight year -- for the first time in 50 years." "Now, it's time to finish the job and balance the budget," the statement added. Administration officials are in the midst of talks with congressional negotiators about a plan to balance the budget over the five years to 2002, but have yet to strike a deal.
ECAT	South Korea's top economic planner said on Friday he would place top priority on reducing the current account deficit and fighting inflation as part of his economic policies for 1997. "Our economic policies will focus on reduction of the current account deficit and price stability," Han Seung-soo, deputy premier and minister of finance and economy, said in a statement. The central Bank of Korea said last week the nation's current account deficit would widen to a record $22 billion for 1996 from $8.95 billion in 1995.   The central bank reported the November deficit expanded to $1.87 billion from $179.6 million a year earlier. Trade officials blamed plunging international prices of the nation's major exports, including semiconductors, for the shortfall. Han also said the government would streamline the nation's distribution system and curb rises in prices of public services to put inflationary pressure under control. The ministry said the nation's consumer price index (CPI) rose 4.5 percent in calendar 1996 against 4.7 percent in 1995.   Han said the government would continue its drive to cut through red tape to improve industrial competitiveness. "We should improve the business environment to help our enterprises compete in international markets," he said. He said restrictions on financing and use of land would be relaxed and the tax system would be improved. -- Seoul Newsroom (822) 727 5645
GCAT	Swedish police said on Saturday that two explosive devices had been discovered in the western city of Gothenburg, a few days after a threat from a previously unknown group to kill hundreds of people on Sunday. Police said the devices, neither of which were armed, were discovered in a large store in a Gothenburg shopping centre and in the central bus terminal on Thursday and Friday. Neither device was primed to explode. On the busiest shopping day of the year on Saturday, security in shops around the country was immediately tightened, especially in Gothenburg and the capital, Stockholm. Police said the threats had been made by a previously unknown group called VSBS, which stands in Swedish for "We Who Built Sweden." The group accused the centre-left government of being responsible for damaging living conditions for the old, sick and unemployed, and said politicians and immigrants were benefitting from their misery. The group said it consists mainly of elderly, working-class people. "We regret they didn't take us seriously, now we have to start acting," VSBS said in a letter received by several Swedish newspapers. "We have received samples of explosives and detonators with some of the letters," said Gothenburg police chief Lars Berg. A letter received by police on Thursday said hundreds of innocent people would die or be maimed in the explosions. The group said it had sent a letter containing dynamite to Prime Minister Goran Persson. Stockholm police spokesman Klaes Cassed confirmed Persson's office had received a threatening letter but declined to comment on whether it contained any explosives. Cassel said police were taking the threats very seriously. Police said they would decide on Saturday whether any Swedish shopping centres should be closed on Sunday, when the group has threatened to carry out its attacks.
MCAT	CBOT corn futures closed lower on a lighter than expected number for corn in USDA's weekly export sales report plus a sharp drop in wheat futures, traders said. "Wheat pressured everything," said Ron Kucha of O'Connor and Co. USDA said Friday that U.S. net export sales of corn in the week ended November 21 were at 582,900 tonnes, below trade expectations for 700,000 to 900,000 tonnes. The market was underpinned by the posting of no deliveries Friday against the December contract. Deliveries were expected to be light but to total at least 500,000 bushels. Friday was first notice day for deliveries on the CBOT December contracts. Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 47,000 contracts, below the 65,335 traded Wednesday. Corn options featured Dean Witter Reynolds purchase of 250 March $2.70 calls at 10 cents. Corn options volume was estimated at 8,000 contracts, about the same as the 8,064 traded Wednesday. Corn closed 1-1/4 to three cents per bushel lower, with December down 1-1/4 at $2.70-3/4. Sam Nelson 312-408-8721

CCAT	Heading off a fresh row with the European Commission, the German government on Tuesday awarded three licences for telecommunications networks to rivals of state-owned Deutsche Telekom AG. The announcement comes just days after rivals to Telekom filed a complaint with the Commission because they said the Bonn government was moving too slowly to approve licences for alternative networks. "Awarding these licences fulfils the promise given to the European Commission that at least two licences for so-called alternative networks would be granted by October 31, 1996," the German post and telecommunications ministry said. Germany had been on a conflict course with Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert because it had so far failed to award licences as required when the Commission agreed in June to approve a new set of charges for Deutsche Telekom. The new rates offer discounts of up to 35 percent to Telekom's corporate customers and were challenged by the company's rivals as discriminatory and anti-competitive. The same companies last week again sought to stop the rates from coming into force in November, saying Bonn had not yet issued any licences and that Telekom was impeding competition. The award of the licences comes as a surprise. As recently as Friday, the post ministry said it could not issue any licences until a new ordinance was passed in parliament, which has still not occured. One licence was granted to Vebacom GmbH, the joint venture of energy group Veba and Cable and Wireless, for the operation of a national transmission network for public communications. Two regional licences for similar networks were awarded to NetCologne, a consortium of municipal companies, covering the Cologne administrative district, and to Colt Telecom, a subsidiary of the U.S. company, covering the city of Hamburg. The government also awarded a licence to Deutsche Telekom to operate a transmission network for public satellite communications services. "This completely opens competition in these areas. Further licences to operate local, regional and national networks will follow shortly," the ministry said in a statement. Deutsche Telekom will still hold a monopoly on public telecommunications services until the end of 1997. But the new licences will allow its competitors to carry communications services in areas already open to competition such as mobile communications and corporate networks on their own networks in competition to Telekom. This could have a huge impact on the prices that companies and mobile phone operators pay for leasing telecommunications lines. For the first time, they will have a choice between Telekom and a competitor. But a spokeswoman for Vebacom said that Germany was still a long way off from introducing full competition to Telekom, which will be listed on stock exchanges next month. "This is a formal act. Now we have the licence, but we're not breaking out the champagne," she said. "We will now prepare our application for a full public telecommunications licence for 1998 and we expect to get one."
CCAT	Second-quarter earnings of aerospace and transportation equipment manufacturer Bombardier Inc. slipped as sales of its motorized personal watercraft declined substantially in the United States, the company said on Tuesday. Bombardier said it had net profit of C$87.8 million ($64.1 million), or C$24 cents (17.5 cents) a share in the second quarter ended July 31, down slightly from C$90.3 million ($70 million) or C25 cents (18.25 cents) a year earlier. Second-quarter sales were C$1.96 billion ($1.43 billion) versus C$1.9 billion ($1.4 billion). For the six months ended July 31, net profit was C$171.3 million ($125 million), or C48 cents (35 cents) a share, compared with C$167.1 million ($123 million), or C47 cents (34 cents) in the year earlier period. Six-month sales were C$3.6 billion ($2.6 billion) versus C$3.5 billion ($2.5 billion). Bombardier said retail sales of its motorized personal watercraft, which includes its Sea-Doo vehicles, "declined substantially" in the United States in June and July. The company said it would reduce production of the Sea-Doo and restructure its watercraft operations, as industry inventories were expected to remain high at the end of the summer season. The restructuring would result in unforseen additional costs, which could reduce its expected net earnings for fiscal 1997/98 by as much as C$70 millon ($51 million), or C20 cents (14.6 cents) a share, Bombardier said. In fiscal 1997, ended January 31, Bombardier had a net profit of C$406.2 million ($296.5 million), or C$1.16 (84.7 cents) a share. Bombardier did not specify by how much it would cut Sea-Doo output, or provide detailed sales figures. Motorized personal watercraft like the Sea-Doo have come under attack in the United States and Canada after a number of fatal accidents involving high-speed collisions with other pleasure craft. After a public outcry, several local jurisdictions in both countries banned the use of the watercraft on certain lakes and rivers. In 1996, Bombardier said its share of the worldwide market for personal watercraft rose to 50 percent from 42 percent a year earlier, but North American industry unit sales had slipped. Rumors of a decline in Bombardier's watercraft sales triggered a sharp fall in the company's share price on Monday. In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday, Bombardier's Class B common shares slipped C$2.80 to C$29.55. After rallying C$0.70 earlier in the day on Tuesday, the stock slipped another C$1.70 on a volume of more than 2.7 million shares, closing at C$27.85. Bombardier shares had reached a 52-week high of C$34 in July almost doubling from their 12-month low.

GCAT	A Cuban scientist leading a team exhuming a mass grave in a remote Bolivian village said on Saturday he believed he had found the remains of legendary leftist guerrilla Ernesto "Che" Guevara. "I have the personal conviction...there are serious signs that this is Che," Dr. Jorge Gonzalez told reporters in the village of Vallegrande in southeastern Bolivia. One of seven skeletons found in the mass grave by the team of Cuban and Argentine scientists has a skull matching Che's heavy facial features and its hands are missing, he said. The Bolivian troops who executed Che in October 1967 cut off his hands as proof they had killed him before burying him in a secret location. But Gonzalez said that final identification of the remains -- one of five skeletons exhumed from the grave on Saturday to be transferred to a laboratory installed in the Vallegrande village hospital -- would require several days of tests. Ironically, the Senor de Malta hospital was where Bolivian troops laid out Guevara's partly naked body in front of international photographers on Oct. 10, 1967. Scientists think the other remains in the grave are those of Che's hapless band of Cuban, Bolivian and Peruvian rebels. The Argentine-born leftist icon and hero of Cuba's revolution was trying to export communism to South America's mainland when he was captured -- wounded and starving -- on Oct. 8, 1967 and shot by a soldier in the village school. Bolivia began the quest for Guevara's bones in December, 1995 after retired Gen. Mario Vargas Salinas broke two decades of military silence to say he could identify the spot where he ordered the burial of the guerrillas. He failed to locate the exact spot and the search has since been repeatedly suspended and resumed, with excavations centering on an airstrip outside Vallegrande, 480 miles (775 km) southeast of La Paz. The search was relaunched in May based on new evidence, including that of a truck driver who said he transported the bodies of Guevara and his comrades. Impoverished Vallegrande has already declared Guevara's bones, when they are found, "the patrimony of the region" with plans to develop a local tourist industry around them. But Bolivia's government plans to give them to Guevara's family, and his Cuban wife, Aleida March, has requested they be sent back to the Caribbean island for a final burial.
MCAT	Brazil's real fell 0.06 percent to close at 1.0151 per dollar in the commercial foreign exchange market after the central bank confirmed market expectations and set a weaker mini-band for the local currency, dealers said. The central bank set the new trading level by buying dollars at 1.015 real and selling at 1.020 reais in a morning auction. The previous mini-band for the fluctuation of the real, set on August 20, was between 1.014 and 1.019 to the dollar. In late afternoon the central bank bought dollars at 1.0150 reais per greenback to support the new mini-band. In the interbank floating rate market, the real dropped 0.10 percent to end at 1.0202 to the dollar. In the illegal parallel market, the real closed flat at 1.034 per greenback, traders said. -- Romina Nicaretta, Sao Paulo newsroom, 55-11-2324411
MCAT	Tokyo stocks faltered after another rocky ride on Tuesday, buffeted by unfounded rumours of government rescue measures and a fall in the yen. The 225-share Nikkei average swayed up and down in early trade but finished with a loss of 122.18 points or 0.70 percent at 17,358.16. It shed more than three percent on Monday. "We're treading on thin ice and the market is bracing itself for a fall below 17,000," a strategist at a second-tier brokerage said. The Nikkei average slumped from the start of trade, undermined by fears that foreign investors would dump their Japanese shares rather than see the home-currency value of those holdings fall further as the yen weakens. Stocks then jumped briefly into positive territory on bargain-hunting and on talk that the Finance Ministry was poised to unveil special steps to prop up share prices -- only to slide again after an official denial. At a morning news conference, asked whether the government had any special stock market rescue steps in mind, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said only that the government would keep working hard on macroeconomic policies. "The government isn't in a hurry to rescue the woebegone stock market, nor does it seem keen to revise the 1997 budget," said Akihiro Naemura, general manager of Okasan Securities. The dollar continued to rise against the yen from the New York closing level in early trade and hovered above 118 yen before being knocked down on Mitsuzuka's comment that the yen's weakness was excessive and that Japan would take action against currency volatility. "The recent weak trend of the yen is excessive," Mitsuzuka said. "We will keep sufficient watch on currency moves and will act properly against wild currency movements," he said. His comments made the market cautious about possible Bank of Japan intervention in the foreign exchange markets. But the dollar then regained lost ground after New York Federal Reserve president William McDonough said in Tokyo that he shares U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's stance favouring a strong dollar. "(Rubin) continues to reiterate something I firmly believe in, that a strong dollar is in the U.S.'s interests," he said. Later on Monday, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto tempered Mitsuzuka's view on currencies slightly by saying that he did not consider the yen's weakness excessive, but what alarmed him was its wild fluctuations. Hashimoto's comments were quoted by Jiji news agency. The dollar was stalled at around 118.00 yen in late trading as the market braced itself for a U.S. Senate testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan later on Tuesday. In the bond market, key March Japanese government bond futures ended slightly easier on position adjustment by dealers and hedge sales related to the government's auction on Tuesday of 400 billion yen ($3.38 billion) worth of 3.3 percent 20-year bonds.

GCAT	Supporters and opponents of the Basque guerrilla group ETA clashed in Pamplona on Sunday, hours after a young politician kidnapped and shot by the rebels died of his wounds. Witnesses said hundreds of angry Spanish youths shouting "Sons of Bitches" and "Murderers" attacked a small group of ETA supporters. They tried to burn the local headquarters of the separatist group's political wing, Herri Batasuna. Police intervened, firing rubber bullets to disperse the protesters. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The violent backlash against the radical separatists erupted shortly after Miguel Angel Blanco, a young Basque politician kidnapped by ETA and shot twice in the head, died of his wounds. Guerrillas abducted Blanco on Thursday and set a 4 p.m. Saturday deadline to kill him unless the government transferred about 500 ETA inmates scattered throughout the country to prisons in the autonomous Basque region. Blanco, a low-level official from Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's ruling Popular Party, was found by a hunter on a country lane in the Basque region shortly after the deadline with hands bound and two gunshot wounds to the head. About 12 hours later, he died in hospital. Police in riot gear tried to break up the clashes in Pamplona between the hundreds of anti-ETA demonstrators and a few Herri Batasuna members who threw bottles and rocks at each other. Police also stopped youths from burning a bar where Herri Batasuna members meet. When the clashes erupted, Pamplona was packed with tens of thousands of visitors celebrating the world-famous running of the bulls festival that began one week ago. The annual fiesta in northern Spain was suspended on Saturday night for the first time in 19 years to show "sadness and indignation" over Blanco's abduction and shooting. A bullfight scheduled for Saturday night was cancelled and the daily morning bull run was called off on Sunday. There was a separate attack on ETA sympathisers in the Basque commercial centre of Bilbao on Satuday night. In the town of Ermua, where Blanco was a town councillor, angry residents tried to burn a Herri Batasuna office on Saturday night but firefighters put out the blaze before it was destroyed. Early on Sunday morning, about 200 people were gathered outside the same Herri Batasuna office but no further violence was reported.
MCAT	COMEX copper settled barely higher in dull, thin choppy trading as the market looked ahead to Friday's LME stock report for direction. "The market remains uncertain about the potential for further increases in warehouse stocks," said analyst Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential Securities. The market was expected to slow down later this week due to the holiday weekend in Britain. The LME will be closed next Monday and there will be no stock report on Tuesday.
GCAT	Sri Lanka's security forces said on Saturday they had arrested two more Tamil Tiger rebels alleged to be responsible for bombing a crowded commuter train and killing nearly 60 people in July, a military spokesman said. The spokesman said the two members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), one of them a woman, were arrested this week following the questioning of a third suspect, Savarimuttu Loganathan, who was arrested last week. "We have now arrested all three terrorists directly involved in the bomb attack on the train in Dehiwela," he said by telephone. At least 57 people were killed and more than 500 wounded when two time bombs ripped apart two coaches of a communter train, as it pulled out of the Dehiwela station in a suburb of Colombo on July 24. A third bomb was defused. Loganathan told reporters earlier this month that he had planted the bombs and got off shortly before they exploded. The military spokesman said security forces had recovered devices to assemble bombs in a Colombo hideout used by the LTTE. Earlier this month, police raided two suspected LTTE safe houses in Colombo and northwestern Puttalam district, during which Loganathan was arrested and a stock of arms and ammunition was seized. The LTTE, fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils, have made sporadic attacks on civilian and economic targets in the predominantly Sinhalese Sri Lanaka. On Thursday, Tamil Tiger rebels opened fire on a civilian bus in eastern Amparai district, killing at least 11 people, including two children, and wounding 27 others. The spokesman said more police and military troops had been deployed in Amparai to bolster security as they normally do in an area hit by a rebel attack. "The LTTE has been attacking civilian targets to provoke an ethnic backlash, and the government and military have been trying to persuade the Sinhalese community to refrain from responding," a government official said. The military spokesman said the rebels on Friday attacked an electricity transformer in the eastern coastal town of Batticaloa but there were no casualties. In the town on Wedenday, rebels had attacked a state oil depot but there was no damage to the oil tanks. Six policemen guarding the oil depot owned by the state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, were wounded in the attack. The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the ethnic war, now in its 14th year.
CCAT	Italian flag carrier Alitalia could close its 1997 accounts in profit for the first time in 11 years, the airline's president Domenico Cempella said in a magazine interview released on Thursday. "On the basis of results for the first half, it is possible that in 1997 there will be a positive result. A year ago few would have bet on this," Cempella told Italian magazine L'Espresso. "For the first time in 11 years, this half we have seen a return to an operating profit of some 10 billion lire," he said. Alitalia chalked up 1.2 trillion lire of losses in 1996, with the government intervening at the end of last year to inject desperately needed capital into the company. Cempella said seat occupancy was now above 70 percent from a previous 67.5 percent while overall productivity had climbed eight percent. He added that the company was worth around 4.5 trillion lire, some 70-80 percent of annual turnover. -- Rome Newsroom ++0039 6 6782501

ECAT	Britain has yet to achieve price stability in combination with economic growth but can do so if it sticks to a consistent inflation target, Bank of England chief economist Mervyn King said on Thursday. "Both theory and history suggest that it (price stability) is within our grasp provided that we continue to pursue consistently a suitable inflation target," King said in a speech to the Economic and Social Research Council in London. "On monetary stability, the test is not whether inflation is below a certain number on a particular date," King said.   "It is whether the regime of monetary policy leads to the widespread expectation that inflation will not be a relevant factor in economic decisions in the future." He said that a modern central bank must be open in its actions and motives. "If it wishes to be judged on a fair and honest basis, it must forsake mystique and mumbo jumbo for transparency and openness." -- Mike Peacock, London Newsroom +44 171 542 5109
ECAT	New Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius on Thursday said he expected economic growth of five percent or slightly more in 1997. Vagnorius made the comment as he presented his government's plans for the 1997 budget and said the rise in gross domestic product (GDP) could be more than five percent. "Although we talk about five percent we expect higher than five percent growth," Vagnorius told a news conference. He also said the government was planning for eight percent GDP growth in 1998 and seven percent in 1999. Growth this year is expected to be around one to two percent after being hit by a bank crisis at the start of the year. Vagnorius came to power in November after his Homeland Union party unseated a party of former Communists in elections. He has pledged to speed up economic reforms in Lithuania, which many analysts say has lagged behind its neighbours Latvia and Estonia in opening up the economy. -- Riga Newsroom, +371 721 5240
ECAT	India's central bank said on Monday the invitation to join the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), central bank to the world's central banks, was a recognition of India's growing economic strength. "Formal accession to membership of BIS will take place on completion of necessary formalities," Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Chakravarty Rangarajan said in a statement. A wide-ranging programme of open market reforms that began in 1991 has seen India tear down the decades-old walls of a socialist protectionist economy. "Being invited to become a member of BIS is a reconigition of India's growing economic strength and the Reserve Bank's growing role in the worldwide cooperation of central banks," Rangarajan said in his statement. It said the invitation signified a closer involvement with other central banks. Earlier, BIS chairman Wim Duisenberg told reporters in Switzerland that the Bank had invited nine central banks all over the world to join it by subscribing to shares in BIS. The other banks were the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the People's Bank of China, Banco Central do Brasil, Bank of Korea, Banco de Mexico, Central Bank of the Russian Federation, Saudia Arabian Monetary Agency and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Based in Basle, the BIS is the world's oldest multilateral lending financial institution, RBI said. It was set up in 1930 to promote cooperation amongst central banks. "BIS is structured as a limited company but it has been established as an international organisation and as such is governed by international law and enjoys privileges and immunities necessary for the performance of its functions," the RBI statement said. -- Bombay newsroom 91-22-265 9000
MCAT	MGE spring wheat futures ended mixed although the nearby December contract gained as locals bought the Dec/March spread, traders said. Traders also said spring wheat drew support from gains in other U.S. wheat markets and from an apparent lack of spring wheat in the latest Commodity Credit Corp catalog. Producer selling remained light, and traders said they expect South Korea may buy some spring wheat in its tender Wednesday for 21,500 tonnes of U.S. wheat. The Dec/March spread widened to trade Wednesday at 12 cents per bushel from nine cents Tuesday. "There wasn't a lot of flat buying of the Dec. It really just gained on the spread," a trader said. MGE spring wheat closed two cents per bushel lower to 3-1/2 cents higher, with Dec up 3-1/2 cents at $3.81-1/2. Wilson Trading bull-spread 500,000 Dec/March at between nine and 11 cents per bushel. Benson Quinn and Continental each bear-spread one million March/Dec in that same range. MGE barley futures closed 10 to 12 cents per hundredweight higher, with Dec up 10 cents at $6.30. --Greg Frost, 816 561-8671
MCAT	Nearby robusta coffee futures reversed an earlier upward trend and finished slightly lower as a weaker New York performance prompted keen selling. Distant months also pared gains but still managed to cling on to positive territory at the close. Traders said the reversal, led by the New York arabica futures, came after a lower-than-expected draw in U.S. certified stock data released late on Monday. "The market was a bit overdone on the upside and I think it carries a bit of profit-taking, and basically New York slips and drags London with it," said one trader. By the close, front-month November was $7 off at $1,520 a tonne after an intraday high of $1,548, and second-position January gave up $4 at $1,453. Forward months were however $1 to $2 higher. Volume on the exchange reached 3,334 lots. London traders said the market reacted negatively to news of a 945 60-kg bags drop in U.S. certified stocks to a new 12-year low of 30,724 bags. Traders in New York said late on Monday the drop, while re-stating nearby supply woes, was well within trade expectation. "People were looking for a larger drawdown on the certified stocks. Some traders tried to get the trade to believe anything between 2,000 and 5,000 bags drawdown," one London trader said. While there could be some nearby tightness for arabica in New York, the London market seemed to be well-supplied with robusta. "London-wise, for a while now there has been consistent origin selling and trade hedge selling as the market steadily rose," one trader said. "This is one of the reasons why London has not been moving as much as New York." -- Jalil Hamid, London Newsroom +44 171 542 4985
CCAT	Ireland's largest manufacturing company Jefferson, Smurfit Group Plc, on Wednesday voiced optimism that a two-year depression in the world paper industry might be nearing an end. "We are beginning to see a re-rating of the industry in recent weeks, predicated on a forward momentum in pricing," chairman and chief executive Michael Smurfit told shareholders at the group's annual meeting. "We think the bottom has been reached and we look forward to the future with confidence," he said. The group announced a halving of pre-tax profits to 201 million Irish pounds ($303.3 million) when it released 1996 results earlier this year. It blamed the profit drop on price weakness caused by excess capacity in the highly cyclical paper and packaging industry. The average price for linerboard, which accounts for more than 60 percent of Smurfit's volumes, fell to $375 a tonne in 1996 from just over $500 a tonne a year earlier and industry attempts to push through a price increase late last year failed. But Smurfit said that there had already been a price increase in newsprint this year and there was a good chance of another one around the turn of the year. He also anticipated price increases in linerboard but said it was more likely to be August than July. Smurfit also told shareholders the group was watching developments relating to Economic and Monetary union (EMU) very carefully. The victory of a Socialist government in France and growing uncertainty about France and Germany's ability to meet the Maastricht criteria for EMU have recently raised doubts that the single currency will go ahead as planned in 1999. "We continue to believe it's the right thing to do, the right thing for costs in the European structure," Smurfit said. Asked about the group's investment in China, Smurfit said it was "extremely modest". "It's an exciting place to do business but also a dangerous place. We are taking a cautious step-by-step approach in conjunction with local people who know their way around," he said. He said China would make a contribution but not a meaningful one to the group this century. He dismissed suggestions that the group diversify into the glass industry, saying the company had considered it but many of its largest customers were big players in that industry. "It would not be looked on favourably if we were to get involved," he said. ($ = 0.662 Irish Pounds)

CCAT	DRB-Hicom group said on Thursday that the 16.25 percent stake held by its late chairman Yahaya Ahmad in British sports car maker Group Lotus Ltd would stay with a company owned by his family. "They will remain with the family company," said newly-named chairman Saleh Sulong, when asked at a news conference about Yahaya's personal investment in Lotus. Last October, Proton Bhd, the national Malaysian car maker, which was also headed by Yahaya, bought a 63.75 percent stake in Lotus for 38 million pounds. Yahaya, who was killed in a helicopter crash on Monday, acquired 16.25 percent of Lotus for 13 million pounds.   DRB-Hicom also said that Yahaya's stake in their companies would be held in custody by Saleh on behalf of Yahaya's children. "I have been appointed as custodian and trustee to the family company...to ensure the shares are intact as they (the children) are still young," said Saleh. "When they come of age, they will not be denied their right to be involved," he said. Yahaya and his associates indirectly own around 65 percent of DRB-Hicom. Yahaya's wife and a pilot were also killed in the crash. Yahaya left behind two daughters aged 24 and 13 and two sons aged 22 and 21.

GCAT	South African President Nelson Mandela met preacher Allan Boesak shortly after his return from the United States to face trial for the theft of anti-apartheid aid funds, a spokesman said on Monday. The statement came amidst a storm of controversy about Justice Minister Dullah Omar's decision to welcome Boesak back on Sunday with a public hug and an airport rally by more than 1,000 people. Omar said he was acting as provincial leader of Mandela's ruling African National Congress (ANC) and on Mandela's specific instructions. "I have done my duty as minister of justice," he said. Boesak appeared briefly in the Cape Town magistrate's court on Monday and was told to return to the high court in August to face 21 charges of theft and nine of fraud totalling about 1.4 million rand ($315,000). The charges were laid by the Scandinavian development agency DanChurch Aid while Boesak, a former leader of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, was head of the anti-apartheid Foundation for Peace and Justice. Boesak said on Sunday he was "totally innocent" and told reporters on Monday he would plead not guilty to all charges. Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Mandela offered Boesak moral support in a meeting at his official residence on Sunday, telling him that getting up was more important in life than falling. "The president knows Allan Boesak at a personal level," he said. "From a human point of view, it is easy to run away from a person when he is in trouble, but the president feels this is the time when someone needs support most." Boesak headed the ANC's election campaign in the Western Cape, one of nine provinces, in 1994 and frequently appeared on platforms with Mandela. Opposition parties castigated Omar for publicly backing Boesak ahead of his trial, which is expected to last at least eight months. "Has Mr Omar taken leave of his senses," said liberal Democratic party legislator Douglas Gibson. "It is time to reassess Mr Omar's fitness as South Africa's minister of justice." The white-led National Party, target of Boesak's tough fight against white rule in the 1980s, said it was disgusted by Omar's "direct influencing of the legal process". "The National Party expects the minister of justice...to dissociate himself from personal appeals for solidarity against an accused," said NP legislator Patrick McKenzie.

ECAT	Consumer prices rose 1.3 percent in Uruguay in July, matching inflation in June and lower than the 1.7 percent rate of July 1996, the national statistics institute said Thursday. In the last 12 months inflation was 20.7 percent, the lowest 12-month rise since December 1982, when it was 20 percent. This compares with 21.1 percent in the year to June and 27.2 percent in the year to July 1997. So far this year consumer prices have risen 10.8 percent compared with 14.1 percent at the same stage of 1996. The government aims for inflation of 15.4 percent this year, meaning the average monthly cost of living increase should not top 0.8 percent. July inflation was driven by food and beverage prices, which rose 1.9 percent; leisure activities, up 1.5 percent; and transport and communications, up 1.3 percent.

GCAT	A motorcade taking Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi to meet supporters near her home was attacked by a group throwing stones, she said on Saturday. Suu Kyi, who was unhurt in the incident on Saturday afternoon, later told reporters the attack might have been orchestrated by the Burmese authorities, and criticised the ruling military government for allowing it to happen. A government official confirmed the incident and said the authorities were investigating. He said a government security officer in Suu Kyi's motorcade had waved his pistol in the air to disperse the stone-throwers. The official said the attack must have been launched by people who objected to Suu Kyi's policies or activities. The Nobel laureate and the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) have been engaged in a standoff over her demand for greater democracy in Burma since her release from six years of house arrest last July. The SLORC has detained and later released hundreds of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party supporters and members at various times in what was seen as an attempt to put pressure on her to curb her activities. Suu Kyi said the motorcade came under attack in the late afternoon as it was leaving the house of U Kyi Maung, deputy president of her NLD, less than a mile (one and a half kms) from her home. The stones smashed the windshields of three cars carrying NLD vice chairman U Tin Oo, security officials and police. After the incident Suu Kyi met several hundred supporters who had waited near checkpoints set up by police to bar public access to her residence. The barriers were aimed at preventing her from holding her regular weekend public gatherings for the seventh consecutive week, NLD sources said. She spoke to her supporters briefly and asked them to return home peacefully, without mentioning the stone-throwing incident, witnesses said. Suu Kyi charged that uniformed security officers stationed in the area had done nothing to stop the stone throwers. "It was very obvious that these people were stationed there at the sanction of the authorities," she said. "These uniformed people did not lift a finger to stop the attackers. The whole thing was carefully orchestrated by the authorities. What kind of government is it that allows such hooliganism," she added.
GCAT	Belgian police hit a snag on Sunday in their search for a possible secret cell in a disused mine complex where convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux might have held victims. Acting on statements by Dutroux and his second wife Michelle Martin, police have been searching the complex in the suburb of Jumet in the southwestern town of Charleroi since December 13. But they hit problems when a stairway they believed would lead straight to the central tunnel of the complex at a depth of 24 metres proved inaccessible because of rubble and concrete. "The stairway which leads to the gallery is inaccessible," Gendarmerie spokesman Guy Soumoy told reporters. He did not rule out police trying again at a later stage to work their way through the rubble. He said that on the basis of indications from former miners, police were now mainly pinning their hopes on a newly-found flooded cellar. "The cellar is the the most important we found today but because of the darkness we cannot do anything about it now," Soumoy said. He said water had first to be pumped out of the cellar and additional equipment brought in. "We now have to see whether there is a passage from the cellar (to the tunnel complex)," Soumoy said. Commander Johan Dewinne, who heads the body identification team of the gendarmerie, said an air current from the cellar indicated that there was another entrance to the tunnels. "(It is going) very slowly indeed, but definitely we have the impression that we're making progress," Dewinne said. The cellar was found after about 80 police had started digging near the stairway to find another entrance to the mine shafts. A large excavator was brought in to dig at another site about 800 metres (2,600 ft) from the stairway. The police, helped by former miners who worked in the area, suspect Dutroux used part of the old tunnels -- linked through the 24-metre deep shaft -- to hold kidnapped children. He once lived in a caravan near the mine complex. Dutroux and several alleged accomplices have been detained since August after two young girls were rescued alive from the secret dungeon of a house he owned. The bodies of four other girls were later found buried at properties connected to Dutroux and an acquaintance, Bernard Weinstein, whose body was also discovered. Police are now searching for at least seven missing children.
ECAT	Mongolia has taken a major step towards reviving its faltering economy with a sweeping plan to slash import tariffs, but the move will cause short-term pain in the landlocked country, diplomats said on Tuesday. Officials on Monday unveiled details of tax changes passed by the Great Hural, or parliament, that scrap nearly all import duties, slash taxes on business and offer incentives to foreign investors, turning the remote country of 2.3 million people into a virtual free-trade zone. The revisions were an important step in pushing Mongolia -- ruled by communists and their heirs for seven decades up to last year -- down the path of a free and open economy, diplomats based in the capital, Ulan Bator, said by telephone. "The government is aiming to really pursue the market economy objective with complete vigour," one Western diplomat said. "They're trying to do away with bureaucracy, they're trying to make it cheaper for locally based firms to import their needs," he said. The reforms, effective from May 1, scrap all import tariffs except those on wine, spirits, tobacco, oil and oil products, and will lower that on oil to 31 percent from 36.5 percent. Foreign investors were more excited that the changes, forged through often bitter parliamentary debate, would slash through the red tape left over from Mongolia's days as a Stalinist satellite of the Soviet Union, another diplomat said. "In the long run they'll be very happy about it, in terms of the money savings, but I think immediately they would hope that this will make it easier to just get things through customs," the second diplomat said. But the tax reductions alone would unlikely be sufficient to draw foreign capital and expertise because overseas firms had already enjoyed tax breaks on imports of capital goods, and because of the many other problems facing investors, he said. The tax revisions may also not be the total embrace of free trade they appeared initially to be, he said. The status of an 11 percent sales tax -- separate from the 15 percent import tariff -- on imported goods was still in doubt and there was talk of levying an export tax on selected items such as cashmere, he said. "Is it really going to be as smooth as it sounds or are we still going to have to jump through some bureaucratic hurdles?" the second diplomat asked. The tariff cuts would lead to a surge in imports -- good for consumers in a country unable to produce many items domestically -- but would put more pressure on Mongolia's currency the tugrik, which has fallen to 800 to the dollar from 500 last June, he said. Mongolia registered a foreign trade surplus of $4.6 million in January-November 1996, down drastically from $79.7 million in the same period the previous year, official figures show. The drop in government income created by the revisions would force deep cuts in public spending, raising the spectre of discontent among a populace already badly hit by rising unemployment and rampant inflation. "(Government officials) know it is going to cause short-term pain, but they believe that it's going to lead to much better economic standards at the end of the day," the first diplomat said. "The people seem to have accepted this and are giving them a chance," he said. "The question is how much longer will the people give them a chance?"
CCAT	British firms W H Allen Steam Turbines and Pebbles Electric said on Tuesday they signed a 7.7 million sterling ($12.3 million) deal with an Egyptian state-owned firm to construct a power generation plant. (Corrects dollar conversion figure to 12.3 million from 5.1 million) "We have signed the deal to build and supervise a steam-powered turbine for Egyptian state firm Societe El Nasr d'Engrais et d'Industries Chimiques for 7.7 million pounds," Richard Buckland, managing director of W H Allen told Reuters. "Pebbles Electric will also take part in this deal," added. Both firms are subsidiaries of the Rolls Royce Group.   Buckland said the Egyptian state firm manufactured urea and that it would use the steam output from that process to generate power internally. The output of the plant, based at Talkha in the Nile Delta province of Mansoura, would be 17.7 megawatts. "We've been doing business in Egypt for the past 50 years and this is significant because it's the first steam turbine we are providing in modern time," Buckland added. -- Cairo newsroom +202 578 3290/91
ECAT	Hong Kong gave the green light on Tuesday to participation in the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), the latest step in its bid for recognition as a world-class financial centre. The British colony's de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), said it would be one of 25 participants in the NAB, a US$48 billion line of credit to be used in situations which could threaten the stability of the world monetary system. The HKMA will be participating with a share of the NAB credit line set at 340 million Special Drawing Rights (SDR), or around US$476 million. "Hong Kong's participation in the NAB is of considerable significance to the territory," said Hong Kong's Financial Secretary, Donald Tsang. "Last year, Hong Kong joined the Bank for International Settlements and we are now taking part in the NAB." Switzerland-based BIS, the world central bankers' club, invited nine central banks to join last September, including those of Hong Kong and China. The invitation from the BIS was regarded in the territory as a vote of confidence in its financial autonomy after it reverts to China at midnight on June 30. Membership in the BIS would also act as a bulwark against any Chinese interference, bankers said. China has promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the handover, including continued circulation of the Hong Kong dollar, an independent fiscal policy which includes maintaining the local dollar's peg to the U.S. dollar. HKMA Chief Executive Jospeh Yam said participation in the NAB was a prudent investment in line with Hong Kong's established investment strategy. Hong Kong's foreign reserves total more than US$60 billion, the world's seventh largest, the HKMA said.

ECAT	Following are comments from U.S. economists after the Labor Department said the Producer Price Index (PPI) rose 0.4 percent in October up from a revised 0.2 percent in the prior month. Excluding volatile food and energy items, the so-called "core" PPI was off 0.3 percent. Experts had expected a 0.2-percent increase in the overall rate and a 0.1-percent rise in the core. PHILIP BRAVERMAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, DKB SECURITIES: "It's wonderful. Even though the energy was the main factor boosting the overall number to 0.4, you have to strip that away."   Braverman made his comments to Reuters Financial Television. SALLY KLEINMAN, SENIOR DOMESTIC ECONOMIST, CHASE SECURITIES INC: "The number came in even weaker than we had anticipated. We got a pickup in food and energy prices, but that wasn't enough to increase the core rate, which dropped. We did get a pickup in consumer non-durable goods, but that was offset by additional weakness in capital equipment prices...As far as the goods side of the economy, there's not a lot of inflation. This probably means Consumer Price Index numbers will be muted going forward."   DAN SETO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, NIKKO SECURITIES CO INTERNATIONAL INC: "Generally a good number. A little bit of a problem with energy prices pushing up. "When the dust settles, I think people will talk about this report as favorable. Energy prices moved sharply higher in the period, but I think people will view that as temporary. "We should begin to see some signs of (lower energy prices) early next month. "Commodity price inflation is really not a problem. We did not expect to see a major problem with inflation here, and in fact this report came in better than expected."   KEVIN FLANAGAN, FIRST VICE PRESIDENT AND ECONOMIST, DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INC: "(The bond market) will continue to operate under the assumption that inflation remains relatively benign -- and that should be good for fixed-income prices. Flanagan continued: "The market's fancy has always been with the core rate and I don't see that changing now."
ECAT	Greece's crucial 1997 budget will concentrate on raising tax revenues by cuts in tax exemptions and intensifying the fight against tax evasion, National Economy and Finance Minister Yannos Papandoniou said in an interview. "The increase in tax revenues will be based on two axes: the first is the abolition of tax exemptions and the second is the intensification of checks against tax evasion," he told Athens daily 'Ta Nea'. The names of major tax evaders will be revealed to the public at the same time as the budget, he said, in an effort to convince the public that tax evasion is no longer acceptable. "Greek society has to comprehend that the government is not afraid," he said. The special tax crimes squad will "be more active in prosecuting major economic crimes, major tax evasion by high income and high-profile earners." Papandoniou said there would be no increases in taxes on fuel and beverages but that there would be "an automatic tax adjustment" on cigarettes. He said, however, that the government would revise pricing practices on fuel, and may consider establishing a competition committee to check excessive profits by fuel trading firms. "We will revise the pricing of petrol products, because we have entered a period of high international petrol prices which is dangerous for international economic balances and for inflation. "We have to look at how the Public Petroleum Company (DEP) prices petrol and other products, because I have a feeling this is inflationary," he told Ta Nea. --Maria Petrakis, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4
GCAT	Peru's Jewish Association added its voice on Tuesday to growing protests against the government's annulment of citizenship for Israeli-born television station owner Baruch Ivcher. A statement from the Jewish community's highest representative body expressed "amazement and unease at an act of injustice that deprives a citizen's right which has been legitimately obtained and exercised since 1984." The association pledged its "solidarity" with Ivcher, the owner of Frecuencia Latina station, and called on Peruvian authorities to "rectify this measure as soon as possible." Sunday's decision to revoke Ivcher's nationality on grounds of bureaucratic "irregularities" has unleashed a tide of media and public outrage and become a rallying point for Peru's increasingly buoyant opposition. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, scores of journalists and Ivcher supporters kept vigil outside Frecuencia Latina's Lima headquarters amid rumors of a possible military intervention to take over the building. Several thousand demonstrators also staged a noisy protest outside the building on Monday evening. They chanted "Ivcher is Peruvian" and held placards saying "Long Live Press Freedom!" and "Down With The Dictatorship." The government canceled Ivcher's citizenship because of alleged omissions in the application forms and lack of proof that he had given up his Israeli nationality. The documents were, however, signed and approved in 1984 by ex-President Fernando Belaunde, who denied on Monday there had been any irregularities. Ivcher, in Miami due to alleged political persecution and death-threats, said on Tuesday that the Peruvian government was carrying out a campaign "to finish off free journalism." The revocation of his nationality followed a string of stories by Frecuencia Latina alleging corruption and rights abuses in President Alberto Fujimori's security forces. Particularly damaging to Fujimori, who is at his lowest popularity level of seven years in power, were stories about the torture of an intelligence agent and the inexplicably high income of security adviser Vladimiro Montesinos. Ivcher, 57, who left Israel in 1970, told Reuters in a telephone interview from Miami that the government had resorted to "gangster-like methods ... to strip my citizenship." "What they want to do is get the channel out of my hands to deliver it to my partners," added Ivcher, who has a Peruvian wife and four children born locally. His partners, brothers Mendel and Samuel Winter, have a minority stake in the channel but are said by Frecuencia Latina journalists to be negotiating the takeover of Ivcher's 54 percent stake. They are widely regarded as pro-government. "They are an integral part of all this plot," said Ivcher, adding that the Winter brothers held dual nationality, Peruvian and Polish. Local media, including normally pro-government sections, have been unanimous in their condemnation of the revocation of Ivcher's nationality. The right-wing Expreso, for example, blamed Peru's military on Tuesday for what it called the "incredible persecution" of Ivcher.
MCAT	Stocks surged Monday, with the Dow index closing at a record high as mutual funds and individual investors sought out blue chips and bargain-hunters scooped up high-tech issues. Based on early and unofficial data, the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 78.50 points at 7,079.39, eclipsing the previous record of 7,067.07, set on Feb. 18.

MCAT	Istanbul shares fell sharply on Thursday in panic afternoon sales sparked by intensfying political worries and the shattering of the index's 1,550 support, brokers said. The IMKB National-100 closed down 71 points, or 4.49 percent at 1,511 after brushing a low of 1,480 in the afternoon. Heavy sales caused trade volume to jump to 27.51 trillion lira ($216.9 million) from Wednesday's 19.75 trillion ($155 million). Brokers said comments by Health Minister Yildirim Aktuna from the Islamist-led coalition's conservative wing led to a rumour -- which was later denied -- that he resigned. Aktuna said earlier in the day he was not hopeful that the ruling Islamist Welfare Party (RP) would support measures to crack down on Islamist activism. "Rumours that Aktuna resigned and thus the government might break up sparked panic sales in the afternoon and produced a sharp fall," said Taner Mirza from Es securities. Political fears had mounted earlier this week due to the RP's opposition to a plan to raise compulsory education to eight years from five as part of measures put forward at the military-dominated National Security Council's (MGK) February 28 meeting to combat rising Islamist zeal. The index had dived 4.48 percent on Tuesday on politics as well as a major rate rise in the Treasury's 399-day bond sale. Mirza said the market, also discouraged by upward bond yields since Tuesday's auction nervously awaited the MGK's Monday meeting.

CCAT	South Korea's Daewoo Securities is considering buying a state-owned French bank based in Marseille which has interests in southern France and the rest of the Mediterranean, officials said on Thursday. A French finance ministry spokeswoman confirmed that Daewoo, a unit of Daewoo Group, had expressed an interest in Societe Marseillaise de Credit (SMC), due to be privatised before the end of the year. She declined further comment on newspaper reports that Daewoo was ready to pump $50 million into the bank, which has long-standing ties with Morocco and Tunisia. She also declined to comment on which other companies were interested in buying the bank. A spokeswoman for SMC said several companies, including Daewoo, were interested in the bank, but said it was up to the government to comment on the sale. She said the bank's management would welcome an offer which preserved SMC's double role as a regional and Mediterranean bank and which also favoured development over dismantlement. French newspapers speculated on Thursday that Daewoo Securities' reported plans to pump money into SMC were taken into account when the government decided on a deal which will give Daewoo Electronics Co control of French television manufacturer Thomson Multimedia. Thomson Multimedia will be sold by France's Lagardere, which is to acquire its parent Thomson and retain its defence interests. SMC posted a profit of 57 million francs in the first half of 1996 after losing 1.3 billion francs in 1994 and 952 million francs in 1995. "It is a bank on the road to recovery," the SMC spokeswoman said. Daewoo said earlier it was considering buying a state-run bank in France which was being privatised but declined to name the company.
CCAT	Indo Mobil Limited, a joint venture between Indian Oil Corp and Mobil Corporation, is chalking out plans to enter India's domestic liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) market, a senior official said on Tuesday. "We are currently looking at a strategy for marketing LPG as a joint venture company," Craig Murphy, chief executive officer of Indo Mobil Limited told Reuters in an interview. Indo Mobil Limited, a 50:50 joint venture between IOC and Mobil Corporation, was set up in 1994 to blend, package and market Mobil-branded lubricants and greases in India, and to market them in Nepal and Bhutan. India's lubricant market is estimated to be about one million tonnes, Murphy said. But he refused to give Mobil's share of the lubricant market. The company has got the highest rating of "1", indicating "good", from domestic Investment Information and Credit rating agency (ICRA) for its proposed LPG venture, Murphy said. He said the company will access IOC port and storage facilities at Kandla in western India to market LPG in western state of Gujarat, Rajasthan and northern parts of Maharashtra. Mobil Corporation has also formed a joint venture with Peevees group, a non-resident Indian group, called Mobil Peevees for marketing LPG in southern India. Mobil Peevees is located in the southern state of Kerala. A multi-purpose jetty is being built near Calicut in Kerala to handle the LPG vessels. The LPG for the project will be sourced from UAE and Saudi Arabia as well as Singapore. Mobil Corp along with India's Pennar group and Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO) is also setting up a five million tonne oil refinery with a total cost of $750 million in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The equity holding pattern for the refinery has not yet been worked out, Murphy said. Mobil Corp is one of the 17 companies which have put in bids to participate in a public sector consortium to distribute liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the country. -- New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024

ECAT	The recent sharp drop in the Irish pound was probably too far too fast for the central bank, prompting them to surprise the markets with a rise in official interest rates on Thursday, analysts said. The Central Bank announced the 50-basis point rise in official Irish interest rates after the markets closed on Thursday, increasing the official short-term facility rate (STF) to 6.75 percent from 6.25 percent. The move followed a four percent drop in the Irish pound against the mark since Tuesday and a fall of over three percent against sterling which forced interbank rates higher, above the level of the STF. Analysts say the bank would have been particularly concerned about the inflationary implications of a 3.5 percent fall in the trade-weighted index against a backdrop of a buoyant economy and strong credit growth. Figures released today showed the adjusted annual rate of private sector credit growth at 18.6 percent in March against 15.8 percent in February although there were some exceptional items involved.   "The central bank will be very unhappy with the way the currency is on a trade-weighted basis in particular. If you go back to their monetary policy statement back in February, they did say if the currency fell on a trade-weighted basis, rates would have to go higher," Oliver Mangan, bond economist at AIB Capital Markets, told Reuters. Eoin Fahy, economist at Ulster Bank, said the bank might be trying to send a signal to the markets that it had not given up on the punt. "Perhaps by taking this rather drastic action at this early stage the central bank may be saying we did have to let the Irish pound fall but we are certainly not happy about that. We are worried about the inflationary consequences and although we had to let it go, we are not happy and we'd prefer to see it up again." But analysts questioned whether the central bank decision would have much impact. "I can't see what it's going to achieve," said Jim O'Leary, economist at Davy Stockbrokers. "It's almost certainly not going to bring about a slowdown in the pace of credit. Any impact it has on the exchange rate is, I suspect going to be temporary." The move is also unlikely to please the Irish finance ministry with the government expected to call an election within weeks, analysts said. Most pundits are predicting a June 6 election, six months ahead of deadline. "I think the government will be surprised at this (rate rise announcement), without question," said Dan McLaughlin, economist at Riada Stockbrokers. Both the central bank and finance ministry declined to comment on the rate rise which analysts say is likely to trigger a round of retail and mortgage rate increases. "Obviously there's a hell of a row going on between the central bank and the government," Mangan said. "Interbank rates would have fallen back over the next week if the currency fell a bit more, down to 2.52 marks. "Guys would have come in and taken profit at that stage and they would have sold back their Irish pounds and that would have depressed the interbank market but the central bank is obviously not pleased with what has happened on the currency front." -- Dublin Newsroom +353 1 676 9779

MCAT	South African stocks posted their second successive rise on Thursday -- after a huge sell-off earlier in the week -- when they received a much needed shot in the arm from better-than expected inflation data. The marked kicked off tentatively, wary of data showing a jump in the money market shortage, but when the consumer price index figures hit the market shares began a strong rally. The data showed a surprise unchanged food component that meant inflation in November rose only 9.2 percent -- below forecasts. "The CPI figures were quite positive for the market," one dealer said. The all-share index ended up 53.1 points to 6,468.0 as industrials put on 89.6 points to close at 7,724.7. After the huge futures-related sell-off at the start of the week buyers were active in the market snapping up stocks seen as being oversold. This bargain hunting was especially active among blue-chip industrials and saw total volumes hit a healthy 844 million rands worth of stock. Fuels group Sasol was responsible for a huge chunk of the trade with shares worth 222 million rand changing hands in volume of 4.14 million stocks. Sasol ended up 200 cents at 56.00 rand. But the main story of the day was the roller-coaster ride of De Beers which slipped heavily earlier in the day on reaction to Wednesday's news that it had given Russia a New Year's Eve deadline for a new diamond marketing deal. The stock hit a low of 121.75 rand before a statement from Russia's foreign ministry that it intended to co-operate with the firm launched a rally. The stock ended 100 cents down at 128.50 rand. "The big story of the day was De Beers. That was what everyone was talking about," one dealer said. Other blue-chips attracting interest were SA Breweries which added 250 cents to 112.50 rand and Gencor which rose 45 cents to 16.70 rand. Dealers said a narrowing of the U.S. trade gap was likely to be bullish for U.S. stocks and any rise overnight on Wall Street would feed through to South African stocks on Friday. "The indications are that Wall Street is going to be positive tonight and that will ramp us up," one dealer said. The golds index was quieter and held onto modest early gains to finish relatively flat at 1,491.3, up 2.6 points, as bullion prices worldwide showed signs of steadying. The futures market also had a healthy day as the all-share March contract stood at at 6,000/15 from 5,911 as the industrials contract edged up to 7,590/605 from 7,474. The gold contract was at 1053/62 from Wednesday's settlement of 1,053. -- Paul Harris, Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003

Team Rental said net proceeds plus a portion of certain financing transactions will be used to finance the acquisition of all the outstanding capital stock of Budget Rent a Car Corp. The deal to buy the car rental company from Ford Motor Co, for $350 million, was announced in January.   Team Rental, which was Budget Rent a Car's biggest franchisee before the acquisition deal, said that the offering will be made through Credit Suisse First Boston, ABN AMRO Chicago Corp, Alex. Brown & Sons Inc, and McDonald & Co Securities Inc., and their international affiliates. The underwriters have been granted an option to buy up to an additional 1.125 million shares to cover any over-allotments.
CCAT	Inland Resources Inc said Tuesday it has set a capital expenditures budget of $28 million for  1997. The oil and gas exploration and development company said the development plan includes the drilling of 80 wells and the extension of existing gas and water infrastructures in the Monument Butte Field of Duchesne County, Utah. It said it set the budget after it received a formal "record of decision" from the Bureau of Land Management relating to an environmental assessment of the Monument Butte area.
MCAT	Thai stocks fell 2.04 percent midway through the Tuesday afternoon session as economic concerns continued triggering sales by jittery investors, traders said. The SET index fell 13.44 points, or 2.04 percent, to 646.66 at 0842 GMT. The SET 50 shed 1.00 point, or 2.05 percent, to 47.72 on moderate 1.99 billion baht turnover.   "Things are really down to the economy. The selling momentum just keeps going on and the banks are being sold now" said a trader at a brokerage firm affiliated to Thai Farmers Bank. Prospects of sluggish economic growth of about five percent this year and market perception that the slowdown has yet to bottom out were main factors depressing sentiment, brokers said. "People are also waiting for more first quarter results. Bank and finance earnings were bad so there is an expectation that other results will also be poor," she said.   Finance stocks, hit by sustained concerns over their deteriorating loan quality and disappointing first quarter earnings, tumbled 4.87 percent. "Stock trading volumes for securities houses to break even is around seven billion baht a day. At the moment we are seeing about a third of that, so everyday most securities companies are facing losses," said a senior local trader. Troubled Bangkok Bank of Commerce fell 0.80 baht to 8.10 after peaking at 9.70 in the morning. --James Mclean (662) 652-0642

ECAT	The National Bank of Hungary's (NBH) Monday interest rate cuts are likely to indicate that June inflation (CPI) figures and other data to be released in the near future, will be positive, analysts and traders said. "I think (NBH president Gyorgy Suranyi) already knows more or less what the June inflation figure will be," said Citibank analyst Csaba Varga. "The June inflation figure must be very good and that may be the reason for the NBH rate cut," said brokerage Gog's securities trader Zsolt Bango. The NBH cut its one-month and one-week reverse repo rates by 25 basis points to 20.50 and 20.00 percent in the morning, then reduced its one-week and overnight repo rates by 0.25 percentage point both to 26.00 percent. The rate cuts were completed by the reduction of the one-year NBH bond yield to 20.03 percent from 20.27. Analysts and traders said NBH president Gyorgy Suranyi's last week remarks on "a cautious interest rate policy" somehat weakened repo rate cut expectations and the NBH moves caught part of the market players unguarded. Some analysts added the rate cuts seemed to be somewhat improvised as they came in the morning instead of the usual early afternoon timing and not all reductions were made at the same time. They said that the reduction of the one-year bond yield was the most surprising as the NBH introduced these bonds three weeks ago to give a support to interest rates. "This was a little surprising after the last week's remarks by Mr Suranyi that he expected an upward correction in short-term government securities yields," said Attila Torok of Postabank Securities. But OTP Securities analyst Peter Bozso was less surprised by the rate cuts as Hungary's forint was strong, forint interest rates seemed to be high enough to attract foreign investments and demand for the NBH's one-year bond was strong at the earlier yield level of 20.27 percent. "A market balance can also be maintained at lower yield levels," he said. Government securities yields rose by between 10 and 15 basis points after Suranyi's comments which followed an up-to- 80 basis points fall, but the yields almost returned to the earlier lower levels on Monday after the rate cuts. Analysts and traders said the rate cuts may encourage most discount Treasury bill yields to drop further and were likely to underline the trend of decline in inflation. Inflation ran at 17.7 percent in May but according to a recent Reuters poll of 12 analysts the 17-month trend of decline should be broken in June, with the forecasts averaging 17.78 percent. Low agricultural prices in the comparative period of 1996 and bad weather earlier this year made a temporary rise in June and July likely, analysts said earlier. The NBH said in a statement last week that inflation was likely to be between 17.4 and 17.8 percent. Analysts agreed that the rate cuts projected a stagnation or a drop in inflation in June and they said a pending revision of May household savings figures by the NBH and April current account data expected for Wednesday were likely be positive. However, inflation was likely to rise in July, Torok said. -- Budapest newsroom (36 1) 327 4040
MCAT	Hong Kong stocks stormed to record highs on Wednesday as the blue-chip index cracked the 16,000-point mark for the first time ever on a revitalised property sector and futures-related trade, brokers said. "The rally is mainly driven by the futures market," said Arthur Feng, in institutional sales at Sassoon Securities. The Hang Seng Index ended the morning session up 263.75 points, or 1.67 percent, at 16,035.81, just off the all-time high of 16,037.36 set earlier in the day. Turnover was a hefty HK$12.10 billion (US$1.56 billion), higher than Tuesday morning's HK$9.85 billion. "The rally is concentrated in Hang Seng Index stocks and hasn't spilled over into second and third liners," said Feng. The July Hang Seng Index futures contract, which expires later on Wednesday, ended the morning session 205 points higher at 15,955. The August contract finished 270 points higher at 16,090, just off the morning's high of 16,110. Brokers also said the market's gains were due to rotational buying, chiefly renewed interest in properties. "Longer term, the property developers do look attractive," said a broker with a large British house. "We are likely to see a selective performance. Hongs (large trading conglomerates) and properties may look better in the near term." The property sector led the market higher, with the properties sub-index soaring 2.89 percent. The finance sub-index was up 1.54 percent. Property giant Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd gave the index its biggest boost, rallying to an all-time high of HK$81.00 before easing to end the session on a gain of HK$2.50 at HK$80.50. Henderson Land Development Co Ltd added HK$2.75 to HK$71.50 and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd climbed HK$2.75 to HK$95.25. Banking giant HSBC Holdings Plc advanced HK$4.00 to HK$265.00 and Bank of East Asia Ltd inched ahead HK$0.10 to HK$32.60. Conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, which had been the focus of much positive market attention this week, eased HK$0.25 to HK$74.50. CITIC Pacific Ltd added HK$0.60 to HK$49.00. China Everbright International Ltd, the second most actively traded share after Cheung Kong, jumped HK$0.45 to HK$5.80. (US$1 = HK$7.74)
ECAT	Polish inflation fell more than expected to 14.6 percent year-on-year in May and analysts were upbeat on future figures but most said credit action was likely to prevent the central bank from cutting interest rates soon. The Central Statistical Office (GUS) said on Monday that consumer prices grew 0.6 percent in May, against one-percent growth in April when the year-on-year rate was 15.3 percent. Prices rose 6.6 percent in the January-May period, compared with a 10.3 percent rise in the corresponding period in 1996. "If the National Bank of Poland (central bank) lowered interest rates we could forget about reducing the pace of credit growth...and I wouldn't count on it (a rate-cut) before the fourth quarter," said Krzysztof Rybinski of ING Bank. Credit grew 13.3 percent to 10.7 billion zlotys in the first five months of the year. Personal credit was up 19.8 percent to 2.3 billion in the January-May period, despite a very restrictive monetary policy and high real rates. Poland's broad money rose by 3.5 billion zlotys, or 2.4 percent, in May to 148 billion after a 2.3 percent rise in April. It grew 9.2 percent in the January-May period against 10.5 percent in the same period of last year. Analysts said consumer price inflation was likely to keep gradually falling for the remainder of the year to end close to the government's 13 percent price growth target, helped by a probable food price fall in the summer season. "The finance minister will always be more optimistic about inflation than banks, but year-on-year 14 percent is possible, as is single digit price growth in 1998," said Jacek Lech, deputy chief dealer at Bank Handlowy SA. Finance minister Marek Belka said earlier on Monday that the government may even revise down its inflation target for December of this year from 13 percent. A monthly Reuter poll of the 26 biggest banks showed their average prediction for year-on-year inflation at the end of 1997 was 14.62 percent, down from 14.93 percent predicted last month. Some analysts said inflation might still rebound in the fourth quarter due to fast wage growth and possible food prices increases later in the year. Many analysts said the central bank was right to keep interest rates on hold to curb fast credit growth and reduce the widening foreign trade gap. Others said, however, that a wide spread between inflation and official interest rates should prompt the central bank to cut rates. "I think such a large discrepancy between the tempo of price growth and interest rates on deposits and credits cannot be maintained any longer," said Tadeusz Chroscicki, chief analyst at the government-linked Centre for Strategic Studies. Chroscicki said he expected a rate-cut of about two percentage points within the next several months. Poland's official rates, at 25 percent for the Lombard and 22 percent for the discount rate, have not been reduced since July 1996, when year-on-year inflation stood at 20.4 percent. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700
GCAT	Police arrested 47 people on Thursday in a crackdown on the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang, which has been battling a rival gang in a bloody turf war that has killed 36 people in the past three years. Canada's Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Quebec's provincial police and several municipal police forces swooped in on the Hell's Angels fortified clubhouse in Saint Nicolas, south of Quebec City, arresting 14 alleged gang members. Three alleged members of a rival biker gang called the Rock Machine were also arrested. Most of the others arrested were suspected drug traffickers, police said. Police also seized cocaine, hashish, and other illegal drugs as well as money and guns. More than 270 police officers participated in the coordinated raids in 32 cities across the French-speaking province. Most arrests occurred near Quebec City and Montreal, RCMP commanding officer Guy Fortin told reporters. "We are very proud to have conducted this investigation. It is going to hurt them," Fortin said. Among those arrested were Marc Pelletier, who police said was the head of the Hell's Angels' Quebec City chapter, and his alleged second-in-command Jean-Rene Poirier. Since mid-1994 when a battle erupted between the Hell's Angels and the Rock Machine for control of Quebec's lucrative drug trade, 36 people have been killed in armed attacks and bombings of bars, restaurants and biker clubhouses. Almost all the victims were affiliated with the gangs, but the car bomb death in August 1995 of an 11-year-old boy in Montreal galvanized public outrage against the biker war. The Hell's Angels are active across Canada and the United States and are a growing presence in some European countries such as Denmark. Thursday's raid was the first since 1993 against the Hell's Angels in Quebec. Last month, Quebec police arrested 20 alleged members of the Rock Machine and froze financial transactions relating to properties and retail store outlets owned by the group. In early May, the Canadian government enacted a law giving police wide powers to investigate and prosecute gangs believed to be involved in criminal activity. The law, which some critics said was vulnerable to a challenge under Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, also allowed police to seize assets involved in the commission of crimes by criminal gangs.
MCAT	U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets near midday Monday remained quiet, with no reported sales of slaughter steers or heifers, feedlot sources said. Packer bids ranged from $65.00 to $66.00 per cwt, with owners pricing cattle at $68.00. Sales were expected Tuesday or Wednesday and most likely at $67.00, which would be steady with last sales on Friday, according to the feedlot sources. Prices were pressured late last week by steep declines in beef prices, although the lower beef prices moved a lot of product out the door, market sources said.   Beef prices at midday remained weak. Beef was quoted down $0.46 to up $0.03 per cwt, according to USDA. Showlists for this week were expected to be steady to larger, although there still were a lot of cattle that were 'green' or unfinished, they said. Feedlots this fall have remained very current by pulling cattle three to four weeks ahead of scheduled marketings. ((Chicago newsdesk 312-408-8720))

MCAT	Nasdaq shares managed to post small gains in mixed trade on Thursday, after defending itself against profit-taking and nervousness for much of the session. The Nasdaq composite rose 3.26 points, or 0.21 percent, to finish unofficially at 1586.66, after forays to negative territory as blue chip stocks remained choppy and on edge. "Nasdaq was resilient today," one trader said. "People tried to knock it down, but it kept fighting back. The expiration looks to buy tomorrow." The broader stock market and bonds had firmed early in the session after the release of July consumer price index data soothed investor fears about resurgent inflation. But stocks then succumbed to nervousness as rally attempts failed. Tomorrow, markets faced options expiry. Networking stocks had a strong showing and lent support to Nasdaq. Ascend Communications Inc gained 1-15/16 to 45-3/4 and Cisco Systems Inc rose 1-7/8 to end at 77. "Cisco was strong, and Micron Technology also rose, which gave a boost to semiconductor equipment makers," a trader said. Shares of personal computer makers also firmed. But bellweather tech firm Intel Corp dipped. ((Wall Street desk 212-859-1730))

ECAT	Ecuador's government is eight weeks away from launching its first Eurobond, of $400 million, an official said Tuesday. An official at the Finance Ministry, who asked not to be named, told Reuters "at least the launch of the bonds will take some eight weeks more." The source said the $400 Eurobond issue will be due in five years and be priced 350 basis points above similarly dated U.S. Treasuries. Finance Minister Pablo Concha recently signed the approval for the issue. The bond will be issued through Chase Manhattan Bank, which will prepare the prospectus for the issue and will look into the pricing of the issue. "The news has had an excellent impact in the markets for Ecuadoran Brady bonds. Country risk is falling and Brady yields fell," said the official. Market talk of the issue sparked interest in Ecuadoran and other Latin American Brady bonds. He added that "this shows Ecuador is considered to have low risk and that the U.S. markets look with optimism at Ecuador's exchange rate plan." Ecuador's government will announce a new economic program on December 1, where a plan of pegging the local sucre to the dollar will also be unveiled. The official said with the Eurobond issue previous plans to issue bonds worth some $40 million in the local market will be cancelled. -- Gustavo Oviedo, Quito Newsroom, 5932 258433
ECAT	The government's proposal to keep the 1997 budget deficit at 2.8 percent of gross domestic product instead of 2.6 percent, as planned earlier, endangers next year's inflation target, the central bank said. Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, President of the National Bank of Poland (NBP), told public television news on Wednesday the government's 13 percent inflation target for the end of 1997 would be difficult to reach with the proposed budget deficit. "With the (1997) budget deficit at 2.6 percent (of GDP), we said that monetary policy would be very restrictive as far as interest rates were concerned.   If the deficit is even bigger, at 2.8 percent, we expect that the 13 percent inflation target is endangered," Gronkiewicz-Waltz said. In September, year-on-year inflation was at 19.5 percent, down from 21.6 at the end of 1996. The government plans to reduce inflation to 17 percent by the end of this year, but analysts considered the target ambitious and see price growth at 18.7 percent in December. Earlier on Wednesday, the goverment proposed a 1997 budget deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP, the same level as projected for this year, along with a recommendation that income taxes be lowered next year. The government said it would try to push through the lower house, which is due to vote on a package of tax bills later this week, a plan which envisages a cut in personal income taxes to 20, 31 and 43 percent next year from the current 21, 33 and 45 percent. The government would also seek a two point cut in the corporate income tax to 38 percent. Last week, the NBP said a budget deficit at 2.6 percent of GDP would likely mean that official interest rates might not be lowered for several months. -- Wojciech Moskwa +48 22 653 9700

GCAT	England did a capable advance job for the bulldozers lined up to flatten Cardiff Arms Park at the end of the season by demolishing Wales 34-13 in another Five Nations record display on Saturday. A four-try English surge in 23 minutes in the second-half allowed Phil de Glanville's side to secure their biggest away win in Cardiff to add to the scoring records they have set against Scotland and Ireland over the past two months. It ensured fittingly handsome send-offs for former captain Will Carling and Rob Andrew, who appeared as a replacement for eight minutes at the end. Both can now walk into the test rugby sunset with another Triple Crown to add to their long list of career achievements. France's 47-20 win over Scotland had ensured the title was out of England's reach before half-time, but their second-half performance made their demise two weeks ago from 20-6 up against France look more illogical than ever. Tim Stimpson, Tony Underwood, Richard Hill and de Glanville all took full advantage of the increasing holes in an injury-hit Welsh side, also equalling England's highest total against their old opponents in 103 meetings. It was scarcely the farewell either the Arms Park crowd or the retiring Jonathan Davies had envisaged and at half-time, like so many of England's games this season, an entirely different outcome looked possible. The match was delicately poised with England just 6-3 ahead and forced into a reshuffle after two injury changes during the interval. Hooker Mark Regan and winger Jon Sleightholme both had to depart early, but it was Wales, already without a third of their first-choice team, who were to crack first. They had already lost Neil Jenkins, whose 50th appearance lasted only 15 minutes before he went off with a broken arm, having uncharacteristically missed with his first two penalty attempts, and prop Christian Loader soon followed. It did not seem to affect them unduly in the first-half but once Stimpson scored his first try for England in the right corner in the 49th minute, their resolve started to ebb away. Underwood capitalised on a loose ball to sprint 60 metres for the second try, while Hill and de Glanville were both assisted by the guile of Jeremy Guscott, one of nine replacements to take the field. Guscott is already inked in as certainty to tour South Africa with the Lions and, after this result, he will not be short of English friends on the flight. Their statistics in recent seasons are undeniable. This was their fifth Triple Crown in seven seasons and their season total of 141 points is a record aggregate for any country in Five Nations history. Teams: Wales - 15-Neil Jenkins (16-Wayne Proctor, 15th); 14-Simon Hill, 13-Allan Bateman, 12-Nigel Davies, 11-Gareth Thomas; 10-Jonathan Davies, 9-Rob Howley; 8-Scott Quinnell, 7-Kingsley Jones (19-Dale McIntosh, 65th), 6-Steve Williams, 5-Mike Voyle (18-Craig Quinnell, 70th), 4-Gareth Llewellyn, 3-David Young, 2- onathan Humphreys (captain), 1-Christian Loader (20-Spencer John, 23rd). England - 15-Tim Stimpson; 14-Jon Sleightholme (16-Jeremy Guscott, 40th), 13-Will Carling, 12-Phil de Glanville (captain), 11-Tony Underwood; 10-Mike Catt (17-Rob Andrew, 72nd) 9-Austin Healey; 8-Tim Rodber, 7-Richard Hill, 6-Ben Clarke (19-Chris Sheasby, 70th), 5-Simon Shaw, 4-Martin Johnson, 3-Jason Leonard, 2-Mark Regan (21-Phil Greening, 40th), 1-Graham Rowntree (20- Darren Garforth, 78th).
MCAT	Yen-based Tokyo gold futures rebounded from early lows to end narrowly mixed as the yen dipped further against the dollar in volatile trade on Wednesday, while spot gold was under heavy selling pressure for the most of the day, traders said. Gold futures ranged from three yen per gram lower to eight yen firmer, with the most-active benchmark December ending flat at 1,326 yen. In the bullion market, spot gold was quoted lower at $351.10/351.50 per ounce at 0736 GMT, against $352.70/353.20 in New York on Tuesday.   "In the early trade, spot gold, weighed down by heavy speculative selling and option-related selling from overseas, barely avoided hitting its support level of $350," one trading house trader said. Spot gold dipped to $350.55 temporarily during Asian hours. In TOCOM gold futures, activity was mainly dominated by two-way business by trading houses, while participation by individual investors was limited. "One focus is whether spot gold will break under $350 in overseas markets, pressured by the stronger dollar," the trader said.  The dollar rose to a fresh 46-month high of 118.75 yen on Wednesday.   Most months in platinum group metals ended in positive territory after sluggish trade. Platinum futures ranged from one yen per gram lower to seven yen firmer. Benchmark December was up three at 1,341 yen. Palladium futures ranged from two yen lower to four yen firmer, with benchmark December ending up four at 458 yen. Benchmark December silver was down 0.8 yen per 10 grams at 179.2 yen. --Tokyo Commodity Desk, +81-3-3432-7431
ECAT	Preliminary CPI data from 10 Italian cities released on Tuesday increased analysts' optimism that inflation would now come in at 3.0 percent year-on-year in October and below that in November, spurring rate cut hopes. "I was already optimistic (of achieving three percent) before the last data and now I am even more so," said Lucia Trevisan at Caboto after initial figures from the last seven sample cities were released. Three other cities released data on Monday. "In November, inflation will be below three percent with almost mathematical certainty. Previously it was just a forecast," said Marcello Esposito of Banca Commerciale Italiana. Martino Dolfini, economist at Chase Manhattan, said he now expected October CPI to come in at between 2.9 and 3.0 percent. "The most striking aspect is that October is a typically inflationary month so it seems to me that after these figures, inflation is looking particularly under control," he said. "I wouldn't exclude finishing the year at 2.5 percent," Dolfini added. Italy's official October inflation data will be published by the national statistics office Istat on November 6. Analysts polled by Reuters on Monday after preliminary figures were released from Milan, Turin and Trieste had forecast an October CPI increase of 3.1 percent year-on-year and 0.2 percent month-on-month. But they lowered their figures to 3.0 percent year-on-year and 0.1 percent month-on-month after Bologna, Venice, Perugia, Genoa, Naples, Palermo and Florence gave their initial data. The 10 sample cities have a combined weighting of 69.8 percent in the total index. Italy's consumer price index in September rose 3.4 percent year-on-year and 0.3 percent month-on-month. Credito Italiano analyst Pompeo Pontone said expectations of 3.0 percent inflation or less by the end of the year "with all that entails for a rate cut" were now strengthening. Analysts said on Monday they expected the Bank of Italy to cut its key discount rate in the middle of November by up to 75-100 basis points if progress with the 1997 budget was on track and official data confirmed their October CPI optimism. The discount rate was last cut in July to 8.25 percent. The Chamber of Deputies (lower house) is due to have finished debating Prime Minister Romano Prodi's austerity budget, which is designed to slash 62.5 trillion lire ($41 billion) off next year's deficit, by November 17. Economists said that could be a timely moment for a rate cut, since the budget then passes to the Senate (upper house), which Prodi's centre-left coalition controls. The budget must by law be passed by both houses of parliament by the year's end. ($1=1,530)
GCAT	Brazil's Justice Minister Nelson Jobim, whose controversial policies on Indian land have caused an international outcry, will be nominated to the supreme court next week, a presidential spokesman said on Thursday. "Minister Jobim will be nominated to sit on the Supreme Federal Tribunal next week," spokesman Sergio Amaral told reporters. A Justice Ministry spokesman declined to say why the minister was changing jobs but Jobim had made it known he wanted to leave the government for a seat on the supreme court. His departure is expected to prompt a ministerial shuffle involving other cabinet members. Indigenous groups in Brazil and abroad have repeatedly criticised a decree introduced by Jobim which allowed non-Indians, including logging and mining firms, to claim areas earmarked as reservations but not yet demarcated.
ECAT	Costa Rican consumer price inflation in August was 0.96 percent, down from 1.17 percent in July, the Economy Ministry said Monday in a report. Accumulated inflation in the first eight months of 1996 was thus 9.1 percent, down from 12.84 percent in the same period of 1995. Year-on-year inflation in the 12 months through August was 18.51 percent, down from 22.35 percent in the period August 1994-August 1995, the report said. --Jose Loria, San Jose bureau 506 2242949
MCAT	White sugar futures were reluctant to stray too far away from their opening levels in solid Thursday volume as price movements were confined to a tight $1 range, traders said. Earlier in the session there was good interest in the October/March spread, which was followed by a spate of against actuals trades in the spot October position. "Even though we've got good volume it's not that liquid today," one trader said. "It's moving nowhere -- we've got a dollar range and that's it. It's pretty unimpressive," he added. At 1605 GMT October was down 20 cents at $348.80. December was up 40 cents at $344.60 and all other traded positions were slightly firmer. Volume totalled 2,062 lots. Traders said the market seemed to have shrugged off news that Syria was open to buy 26,000 tonnes of white sugar and 26,000 tonnes of raws for Oct/Nov delivery to replace a cancelled tender. The final date to receive offers is September 4, with replies to be made on September 5. Both the whites and raws should be delivered between October 10 and November 10 in two equal cargoes of 13,000 tonnes each. Pakistan is said to be considering buying another 200,000 tonnes of refined crystal whites for September and October deliveries. The pattern was similar in Paris where volume amounted to 1,671 lots. October was down 50 cents at $348.50 and December unchanged and bid at $345.00. -- Jeremy Smith, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8064
MCAT	Rumors that Japan was buying U.S. pork bellies boosted CME pork belly futures to eight-month highs and values ended sharply higher, traders said. Hog futures saw profit taking after setting new contract highs early on demand sparked by strong cash markets, they said. Pork bellies closed 1.000 to 3.000 cent a lb higher with May up 1.950 at 84.550 cents after being up to 84.950 cents earlier, the highest level since August 8. The February belly contract set a new high of 73.500 cents and November fresh contract was up the limit on a high bid. Hog futures ended 0.500 to 0.200 cent a lb higher with June up 0.375 at 83.450 cents after setting a new high of 83.900 earlier. July, August and distant June and July also posted new contract highs on the early advance. Rumors that Japan was buying light-weight U.S. pork bellies sent belly futures to the highest levels since August. Japan does buy eight- to ten-lb bellies from the U.S. and other countries, but the interest appears to be coming at a time when competition from other countries is down and U.S. frozen belly wstocks are set to slip below year-ago levels, some sources noted.   "The only reason they are buying bellies from us is because Taiwan is out of the picture," said Chuck Levitt, senior livestock analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. "They (Japanese) always buy small amounts from us of the very light bellies but the main supply of bellies that they use comes from elsewhere, not the U.S.," Levitt added. The CME weekly Out-of-Town Storage Report also supported bellies from the start. The report was considered bullish based on the CME report of a net in-movement of 353,000 lbs versus large 1.99-million-lb in-movement last year, they said. The current rate of storings also offset expectations that Friday's U.S. monthly Cold Storage Report will show frozen belly stocks rising last month to exceed year-ago levels. Belly storings were light last year in March and rose this year during March because of a hedge to the board. However, since early April, there has been no hedge and visible storings have been light. This compares with heavier storings last year in April when cash prices shot up to over $1 a lb. With stocks seen at or under year-ago levels by the end of April, there is speculation belly prices will go much higher. LFG and Cargill Investor Services were buyers in bellies, traders said. E.D.&F. Man, R.J. O'Brien, LIT division of First Options and Rand Financials also were notable buyers, pit sources said. Hog futures ran up to new contract highs on spillover support from pork bellies and demand prompted by stronger cash hog markets. Expectations of higher cash hog markets again Thursday added to the advance, but trade turned slow and somewhat nervous over the action in cattle pits, traders said. Hog runs tightened after animals backed up by last week's storm came to market earlier in the week. This sparked short covering much of the day, especially since hog marketings are seen tightening further on a seasonal basis and as farmers take to the fields for spring planting, they said. LIT division of First Options notably bought June hogs and locals bought July. In hog options, commission houses offered June 84 to 90 calls early and bought July and August 80 calls late, pit sources said. ((Jerry Bieszk 312-408-8725))

CCAT	Commerzbank AG said on Friday it did not yet have a buyer for its remaining 24.99 percent stake in Kolbenschmidt AG. "We don't have a concrete interested party at present," a bank spokesman said in response to a Reuter enquiry. The spokesman did not rule out a renewed arrangement with British car components supplier T & N Plc, whose option to buy the stake from Commerzbank expired at the end of 1996, the spokesman said. "We are not in any dispute with T & N", the spokesman said. But he added that the bank was now free to dispose of the stake as it pleased. T & N had an option to buy Commerzbank's former 49.99 percent holding in Kolbenschmidt but was prevented from doing so by German cartel authorities. Commerzbank in December transferred the other half of its Kolbenschmidt stake to Metallbank GmbH, which was acting on behalf of a group of European investors, and T & N said it had extended its option to buy that portion until September 1997. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

CCAT	Dutch brewer Heineken NV said on Friday it had no plans to close any breweries at its newly acquired French units Fischer and Group Saint-Arnould. "There are no concrete plans for restructuring...and no plans to close any breweries," chairman Karel Vuursteen told a press conference shortly after the group announced a six percent rise in first half net profit to 297 million guilders. In February, Heineken took a majority stake in Fischer Group and its French unit Sogebra SA took a 66 percent stake in Group Saint-Arnould. Vuursteen said earlier it would be around three years before these units contributed to net profit. Heineken earlier issued a profit warning, saying stagnant European beer markets would put growing pressure on margins, and contribute to lower net profit in full-year 1996 versus 1995. Vuursteen said poor summer weather in southern Europe had contributed to a loss of one million hectolitres in beer sales over July and August. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
